She excelled at one of the toughest military schools, the Imperial Academy on Carida, and finally caught the eye of Moff Tarkin, who took her on as a protégé and a lover. Tarkin wanted to keep both her and an ambitious new project he had conceived hidden from the Emperor. So he put Daala in charge of a top-secret weapons research facility, the Maw Installation, deep in the black-hole fields outside Kessel. He also gave her four Star Destroyers to command and the rank of admiral. The facility, which employed 180,000 people, produced plans and a prototype for the Death Star battle stations, the World Devastators used in battle against Mon Calamari, and the Sun Crusher fighter.<br>The Maw Installation was completely isolated for 11 years.

The admiral decided to seek revenge by unleashing the power of her ultimate weapon, the Sun Crusher, against the New Republic.

Dathomir is inhabited by the Witches of Dathomir, a group of Force-sensitive women who ride fearsome rancors. The planet is covered with a wide variety of terrain including mountains, deserts, purple savannas, and forests of 80-meter trees and vines bearing hwotha berries. Indigenous life includes flying reptiles, piglike rodents, long whuffa worms, burra fish, and rancors. Semi-intelligent, two-legged reptiles live in the desert and call themselves the Blue Desert People. Humans came to Dathomir when a group of illegal arms manufacturers were exiled to the planet by the Jedi Knights. Several generations later, a rogue Jedi named Allya was also exiled to Dathomir. She began to teach the Force to the planet’s inhabitants and to her descendants, who also learned to tame the wild rancors. Nearly 400 years before the Battle of Yavin, the two-kilometer Jedi academy ship <i>Chu’unthor</i> crashed in a Dathomir tar pit. Jedi sent to recover the crashed ship were repulsed by the witches. Different clans of these witches (Singing Mountain, Frenzied River, and Misty Falls) were formed, including a group of dark siders calling itself the Nightsisters. Life among the clans followed a pattern of female dominance, and males were largely used as slaves for work or breeding.<br>Imperial forces constructed orbital shipyards and a penal colony on Dathomir’s surface. But after Emperor Palpatine learned the power of the Nightsisters’ leader, Gethzerion, he ordered all the prison’s ships destroyed to prevent her from leaving the planet. The stranded Imperials at the prison were then enslaved by Gethzerion and the other Nightsisters. Four years after the Battle of Endor, Han Solo won the planet in a high-stakes sabacc game from Warlord Omogg, who claimed it had been in her family for generations. Han’s subsequent adventures on the planet resulted in the destruction of both the Nightsisters and the forces of Warlord Zsinj. About 15 years after the Battle of Endor, a new order of Nightsisters based in the Great Canyon emerged.

The crime of the politically active parents: speaking out against the Empire’s destruction of Alderaan and its billions of inhabitants. Kyp and his parents were sent to the Imperial Correctional Facility on the planet Kessel where they were pressed into slave labor, mining the powerful drug called glitterstim spice from pitch-black tunnels.

Still, in an act of vengeance, he removed the memories from the mind of reformed Imperial weapons developer Qwi Xux.

He looked the role, with his close-cropped graying hair and long, gold-beaded mustache. Gallandro always wore expensive, well-tailored clothing. His blaster holster was slung low, and his white scarf hung like a badge of office. Over the years, a death mark was put on his head by more than 100 planets, but no bounty hunter was brave enough, or foolish enough, to take him on.<br>He was hired by Odumin, a powerful regional administrator for the Corporate Sector Authority, to take out a five-member family. He did the job so well that Odumin put him on retainer for other “messy” jobs. Gallandro was on the planet Ammuud when he first encountered Han Solo, who had been trapped by security police. Han tricked him into grabbing a case that sent shocks to Gallandro’s gun hand, and Gallandro let Solo go. They later encountered each other on Dellalt, where both were searching for the long-lost treasure of Xim the Despot. Han found the treasure chambers and Gallandro challenged him to a duel. Gallandro fired first, hitting Han in the shoulder, and then attempted to kill one of Han’s associates. But the chamber had been rigged to combat such disruptions, and a dozen lasers shot forth and incinerated Gallandro on the spot.\",\"category\":\"H\",\"references\":[\"HLL\",\"HSR\",\"SWCG\"]},{\"name\":\"gameboard\",\"originalName\":\"gameboard\",\"description\":\"A holographic projection table used for amusement purposes in the game of dejarik.

Kun was responsible for the deaths of millions four millennia before the rise of the Empire. Killed by an overwhelming force of Jedi, the dark spirit of Exar Kun survived across the vastness of time to challenge Luke Skywalker and a new group of Jedi trainees.<br>Kun was tutored in the ways of the Force on Dantooine by Master Vodo Siosk-Baas. The proud Jedi pushed himself hard, but he was pulled to the dark side of the Force and secretly used his master’s Jedi Holocron to learn about past Dark Lords of the Sith, such as Freedon Nadd. Posing as a Jedi archaeologist, Kun traveled to Onderon to examine Nadd’s Sith artifacts. Jedi Master Arca Jeth saw through Kun’s lies, and an angry Kun left for the city of Iziz and then the Dxun moon to explore Nadd’s influence. Inside Nadd’s tomb he was confronted by the spirit of the Dark Lord himself and was led to two scrolls that contained great Sith secrets. These scrolls in turn led Kun to the desolate planet of Korriban, where, with the help of Nadd’s spirit, he gained access to the Sith tombs.<br>Kun had second thoughts and tried to back out, but was felled by Nadd’s spirit in an attack that left him near death. The only hope, the spirit proclaimed, was to fully embrace the dark side, and however reluctantly, Kun did. In the time that followed, Nadd’s spirit filled him with tales, especially those of the ancient Sith Lord Naga Sadow and the experiments Sadow had performed on the moon of Yavin 4 to give flesh to the spirits of the dead. Nadd told Kun that he must complete Sadow’s work and give Nadd a new body.<br>On Yavin 4, Kun again renounced the dark side, but was attacked by the Massassi, mutated descendants of Sadow’s alchemy. They prepared him for death in a Massassi Blood Sacrifice, and Kun again turned to the dark side to save his life. He slaughtered all who would oppose him, including Nadd’s spirit, but not before it cried out a warning to two other followers, Aleema and Satal Keto, founders of the dark side mystical sect, the Krath.<br>In the months that followed, Kun had the Massassi build huge temples of an ancient Sith design to focus great dark-side energies. He also continued Naga Sadow’s experiments, turning the Massassi into monstrous creatures of death. Then he headed for the Empress Teta system to destroy Nadd’s final Sith followers. He arrived as Jedi Knights were attacking the Krath stronghold. But Aleema and fallen Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma survived. Blasting Aleema with dark-side power, he and Qel-Droma engaged in a blistering lightsaber duel. Sith amulets that both men wore began to glow with energy and ancient Sith Lords appeared and bestowed the title of Dark Lord of the Sith on Kun, and the title of Sith Apprentice on Qel-Droma. Eventually they and Aleema joined forces to try to bring down the Republic and the Jedi Knights.<br>At a Great Council of Jedi convened on Deneba, Master Vodo Siosk-Baas volunteered to try to turn his former student from the dark side, but Kun slew his master. The bloody battles that ensued, known for all time as the Sith War, resulted in millions of deaths. In the end, Qel-Droma betrayed Exar Kun, revealing the secret of Kun’s power base on Yavin 4. The resulting battle leveled most of the moon’s temples and destroyed Kun’s body, but he drained the life force from every Massassi, an act that kept his spirit alive but trapped in the remaining Yavin temples.<br>Some 4,000 years later, the Rebel Alliance briefly established a base on Yavin 4. Later, Luke Skywalker opened a Jedi training academy based in Yavin 4’s Great Temple. Exar Kun’s spirit stirred, tempting first one then another of Skywalker’s trainees into turning to the dark side. He enlisted one promising Jedi, Kyp Durron, until Skywalker saw what was happening and confronted Durron. With the help of Kun, Durron attacked his teacher and used dark-force lightning to separate Skywalker’s spirit from his body. But Kun didn’t reckon on the combined strength of the remaining students, who protected Skywalker’s body from destruction, then set a trap for Kun. They focused their will into a single entity of the Force, finally snuffing out Kun’s spirit, restoring Luke’s essence to his body, and freeing Durron from the hold of the dark side.\",\"category\":\"H\",\"references\":[\"SWCG\",\"DA\",\"DLS\",\"TSW\",\"COF\"]},{\"name\":\"Kwerve, Bidlo\",\"originalName\":\"Kwerve, Bidlo\",\"description\":\"A scar-faced Corellian with white-streaked black hair.

The legendary Kaiburr Crystal, rumored to have properties that focus and intensify the Force, was located deep in the jungle, in the temple of a minor local god named Pomojema. The powerful crystal rested within a ceremonial statue of the god and was guarded by a sluggish but deadly lizard creature. Soon after the Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO crashed on Mimban while traveling to a conference on Circarpous IV.

The Quarren inhabit the lowest, darkest levels. These attractive cities include Reef Home, Coral Depths, Kee-Piru, Coral City, Heurkea, Foam-wander City, the Domed City of Aquaris, and Morjanssik.<br>The architecture and design of Mon Calamari has an organic appearance, with rounded edges and irregular surfaces, demonstrating the inhabitants’ love for the natural beauty of their world. Raw ores used in construction are mined by the Quarren (who can breathe both air and water) from domed cities on the ocean floor. A permanent history of every planetary event is maintained by a community of meter-long, bivalve mollusks, who are extremely intelligent and will communicate their knowledge to those who ask.<br>The Calamarian seas are also home to the dangerous predators known as krakanas, sharklike animals with twin pincer tentacles. The rare ultima-pearl is found in the seabeds. Massive sea slugs, plying Calamari’s oceans, use the Force to draw plankton into their mouths. Other species include the eellike choarn, lampfish with luminous tongues, and the endangered whaladons. In ancient times the planet supported now-extinct, 10-legged crustaceans known as mammoth krabbexs.<br>The Mon Calamari had already constructed enormous starships and begun traveling space when their planet was discovered by the Empire. The Imperials planned to enslave the planet and, after meeting native resistance, destroyed three of its floating cities. A Quarren, Seggor Tels, is believed to have deliberately lowered Calamari’s defenses to allow the Empire’s attack; ever since, tension has been high between the Mon Calamari and the Quarren. After the Empire’s aim was made clear, Calamarian starships were converted into warships and the shipbuilding docks in orbit around Mon Calamari and its single moon became an important resource for the Alliance.<br>Many Calamarians were enslaved by the Empire, including the famous Ackbar, who was forced to be the personal servant of Grand Moff Tarkin. Ackbar was rescued from slavery by an Alliance force and later named admiral of the Rebel fleet. Six years after the Battle of Endor, the reborn clone Emperor used his World Devastators to attack Mon Calamari’s southern territorial zone, destroying most of Kee-Piru and Heurkea. The port city of Hikahi was also damaged, hurting the planet’s starship-building capability. Calamarian ships form the backbone of the New Republic fleet. But with the help of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, the Devastators were defeated. A year after that attack, Princess Leia Organa Solo visited Admiral Ackbar at his home in the seatree forest to bring him out of his self-imposed exile.

The 2,000 stars of the Koornacht Cluster burn so brightly in N’zoth’s night sky that more distant stars are never visible, which contributed to the Yevethan view that their species was the only one in the universe.<br>Females of the species are called marasi and males are called nitakka. Young are born in separate “birth-casks” called mara-nas. Yevetha only consider killing to be murder if someone of lower status kills someone of higher status. High-status males have every right to kill their lessers for any reason, and such killings are commonplace and accepted. Yevetha are extremely adept with technology and learn new skills rapidly.<br>By the time the Empire arrived in the Cluster, the Yevetha had spread from N’zoth and colonized 11 nearby planets, even without hyperdrive technology. The arriving Imperials established an orbiting repair yard (code-named Black 15) at N’zoth and established a planetary garrison on the planet’s surface. The Yevetha were forced to work as Imperial slaves and learned much about the Empire’s technology by servicing its ships at the repair yard. <br>Eight months after the Battle of Endor, faced with mounting losses in battles with the New Republic, the Empire planned to evacuate all forces from N’zoth and to destroy the Black 15 shipyard. Yevethan leader Nil Spaar and his commando team used the confusion of the moment to capture the Super Star Destroyer <i>Intimidator</i> and murder 20,000 Imperial citizens by firing the <i>Intimidator</i>’s turbolasers on the evacuation transports. He then claimed the yards and all nine of its capital ships in the name of the Yevetha Protectorate.<br>Nil Spaar took over as viceroy of the Duskhan League after the death of former viceroy Kiv Truun. The Black 15 yard was later moved away from N’zoth to a clandestine location.

Although heralding from an unidentified race of humanoid predators known for their aggressiveness, Odan-Urr was a pacifist who loved books and sought knowledge through research. He shunned combat, but followed Ooroo's request to aid Empress Teta in quelling an uprising on Kirrek.

Soon after, he predicted the arrival of the Sith and the Great Hyperspace War.<br>With Jedi Master Ooroo, Odan-Urr returned to Kirrek and defeated the Sith forces there, although Ooroo was slain in the combat.

Recognizing the importance of preserving and protecting such artifacts, and wishing to honor Ooroo's memory, Odan-Urr returned to Ossuss and established the Great Jedi Library.

Native life on the planet includes the deadly dragon-bird. Over 4,000 years before the Battle of Yavin, the Dark Jedi Freedon Nadd brought the power of Sith dark-side magic to Onderon, and those who opposed him were cast into the wilderness, where they eventually banded together and tamed the beasts of Dxun. Hundreds of these \\\"beast riders\\\" created their own kingdoms in the wild, and fought continually to overtake Iziz. <br>Four hundred years after Nadd's death, Onderon was first contacted by the Old Republic, and a delegation of Jedi including Ulic Qel-Droma was sent to make peace between the beast riders and Queen Amanoa of Iziz. Following the death of Queen Amanoa, her daughter Galia took the throne with Oron Kira, her lover and the leader of a beast rider kingdom. A subsequent uprising by the followers of Freedon Nadd was put down by another Jedi force. At the same time, Satal Keto and his cousin Aleema, members of Tetan royalty, traveled to Onderon to learn the secrets of Sith magic, which led to their formation of the Krath and the political takeover of the Tetan system.

There is even some speculation that the Order of Jedi Knights began on the planet. Ossus was once covered with many cities and ground defenses, with the Knossa spaceport located near a range of rocky mountains. Points of interest included the Great Jedi Library and the peaceful Gardens of Talla. The steep canyon walls are still covered with elaborate murals, and some ancient buildings that still stand include the library and a Jedi meditation chamber. <br>Five thousand years before the birth of Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master Ooroo instructed Odan-Urr in the ways of the Force on Ossus.

Among his students were Nomi Sunrider, Shoaneb Culu, Tith Kark, Qrrl Toq, and Dace Diath. During the Great Sith War, the fallen Jedi Exar Kun visited Ossus to recruit 20 Jedi Knights into the Sith cause. Before he departed, Kun killed Master Odan-Urr and stole a Sith Holocron from the Jedi Library. Later, an Ossan Jedi fleet was dispatched to the nearby Cron Cluster to defend the besieged station Kemplex Nine. The fleet was destroyed when the Cluster went nova, and the resulting shock wave threatened to devastate Ossus. An evacuation of the planet was ordered, and as many ancient relics as possible were loaded onto transports. At the same time, Kun and corrupt Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma appeared with their armies to loot the world of its valuables before the shock wave arrived. Kun battled the Neti Jedi master Ood Bnar, who turned into an unyielding tree to protect a trove of the earliest known lightsabers. <br>Meanwhile, Ulic confronted and killed his brother Cay, and was seized with horror and regret over what he had done. Most Jedi left the planet just ahead of the shock wave, which scorched and nearly wiped clean the surface of Ossus. Some Jedi survived, however, after hiding their families in Ossus' great caverns, and their descendants grew into the Ysanna, a tribe of warrior-shamans who use the Force to guide their primitive weapons. A 10,000-year-old lightsaber, given to Leia Organa Solo by Vima-Da-Boda, surfaced over 800 years before Leia's birth in an archaeological dig on Ossus. Six years after the Battle of Endor, Luke Skywalker visited an arid, sandy portion of the planet and discovered the Ysanna tribe.

In his more than 50 years of service, first to the Old Republic and then to the Empire, Pellaeon was always a military man with a conscience, which some mistook for weakness. But Gilad Pellaeon wasn’t a survivor because he was a coward; he just thought it smarter to live to fight another day rather than commit some foolish sacrifice.<br>The Corellian, who had lied about his age, graduated in the top third of his class at the Naval Academy. Quick thinking to thwart pirates on his first assignment led to an appointment to the command crew of the Star Destroyer <i>Chimaera</i>. Over the years, he worked his way up to second-in-command, achieving the rank of captain. During the Battle of Endor, the <i>Chimaera</i>’s commander was killed along with other officers and Pellaeon took control of the ship. Seeing the rout before his eyes, he reluctantly ordered the few surviving Imperial ships to withdraw.<br>Captain Pellaeon worked with others for years to bring the remnants of the Empire together. Just when he despaired most of the Empire getting a strong new leader, Grand Admiral Thrawn appeared and chose the <i>Chimaera</i> as his new headquarters ship. Thrawn listened to the captain’s opinions, even though he ignored many of them. Pellaeon commanded the <i>Chimaera</i> in the Battle of Sluis Van. Acting on Thrawn’s orders, he then hired Niles Ferrier and Mara Jade to find the location of the long-missing <i>Katana</i> Dreadnaught fleet. Thrawn’s big problem, Pellaeon knew, was overestimating the loyalty and abilities of those who surrounded him. The Battle of Bilbringi was not going well for the Imperials when Rukh, Thrawn’s Noghri bodyguard, killed the admiral. Pellaeon again felt he had no choice but to call a retreat.<br>Years later, with a promotion to the rank of vice admiral, Pellaeon headed the fleet of an Imperial warlord, High Admiral Teradoc. He encountered Admiral Daala, who was trying to get the squabbling Imperial forces to band together, and aided her by inviting the 13 strongest warlords to a unification meeting. But talking didn’t accomplish the task, and Pellaeon watched when Admiral Daala gassed them all. As part of Daala’s grand strategy, Pellaeon led a fleet of Star Destroyers to join with her and destroy the Jedi academy on Yavin 4. But Pellaeon’s fleet was hurled across space by a Force storm brought about by the Jedi trainees, and by the time he got back to the vicinity, the New Republic had vanquished Daala. She had survived the destruction of her ship in an escape pod, and in recognition of yet another failure, handed over her command, and command of the Empire’s forces, to Pellaeon.\",\"category\":\"H\",\"references\":[\"HE\",\"DFR\",\"LC\",\"HESB\",\"DFRSB\",\"DS\"]},{\"name\":\"pelvic servomotor\",\"originalName\":\"pelvic servomotor\",\"description\":\"A small motor that gives two-legged droids the ability to walk.\",\"category\":\"T\",\"references\":[\"SWSB\"]},{\"name\":\"Peregrine's Nest\",\"originalName\":\"Peregrine's Nest\",\"description\":\"Garm Bel Iblis’s last hidden base before his strike force rejoined the New Republic.

Ulic's failure wreaked havoc on the galaxy. Trained along with his younger brother Cay on the mining world of Arkania by Jedi Master Arca Jeth, Ulic Qel-Droma quickly mastered the art of lightsaber dueling. Even then, his self-confidence and brashness made him appear arrogant to some. When he felt they were ready, Master Arca sent the Qel-Dromas and their training partner, Tott Doneeta, to Onderon to help put an end to the violent civil war between the city dwellers and outlander beast-riders. <br>However, the walled city, Iziz, was still full of dark side power some 400 years after the fall of the Sith Dark Lord Freedon Nadd. After some difficulties, Master Arca arrived and helped the outlanders win the war. Soon after, the Jedi found the crypt of Freedon Nadd, leading to an uprising by Nadd loyalists, who kidnapped Master Arca and captured Iziz. Ulic led a contingent of Jedi to free his master and killed King Ommin, Nadd's direct descendant, putting an end to the uprising. During the Freedon Nadd affair, Ulic met and fell in love with another Jedi, Nomi Sunrider, but he was pulled away from her when he was named Watchman of the Empress Teta system. <br>In the following months, two spoiled royals who had been exposed to Sith teachings by the spirit of Freedon Nadd formed the Krath, a group of dark side sorcerors. The Krath fomented war among the Teta system planets, and Ulic decided to infiltrate the group and learn their secrets. Aleema and Satal Keto, the Krath's founders, played along with Ulic. Satal eventually betrayed Ulic and injected him with a slow-acting poison that would make his return to the light side impossible. Ulic later survived an assassination attempt by Satal, and saw Nomi escape Satal's imprisonment just hours before he had agreed to kill her to prove his loyalty to the Krath. Nomi and Cay Qel-Droma failed in their attempt to rescue Ulic from the Krath, and the anger inside Ulic exploded, leading him to kill Satal. <br>Aleema gave him half of a Sith amulet that had been given to Satal by the spirit of Freedon Nadd, furthering Ulic's transformation. Ulic was then confronted by another fallen Jedi, Exar Kun. As they engaged in a lightsaber battle, both Jedi were visited by the spirits of ancient Sith lords who told them that Kun was to become the new Dark Lord of the Sith, with Qel-Droma his first assistant. <br>Years later Ulic reappeared with tremendous dark side powers, and with a large and bloodthirsty army. Serving alongside Exar Kun, he set out to plunder and destroy large parts of the galaxy.

Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, pro-Alliance members of the Ralltiir High Council tried to restore balance to the markets.

As the pirates struggled to untangle themselves, Calrissian hit them with ice blocks from the moon’s ring, causing even further damage. Finally, Calrissian led the Taanab defense fleet in a cleanup operation and singlehandedly accounted for nineteen kills. Later, just prior to the Battle of Endor, Calrissian was promoted to the rank of general in the Alliance partly thanks to the notoriety of this incident, which became known as the Battle of Taanab.

Public executions of rebellious carbonite miners were held in the central plaza of the ruling Tetan city of Cinnagar.

Although the Vratix already had colonized other bodies in their system, contact with the Republic ushered in a technological revolution.<br>The Vratix soon invented the healing fluid called bacta by growing alazhi and mixing it with the chemical kavam. The remarkable fluid was extremely profitable, and powerful Vratix operations spread across many worlds. With the rise of the Empire, two large bacta-harvesting corporations, Xucphra and Zaltin, negotiated a special deal with the Imperials, allowing the companies to gain a virtual monopoly on the bacta industry. The conglomerates controlled 95 percent of the galaxy’s bacta and became known as the Bacta Cartel. The human-owned companies long dominated the lives of the Vratix and ran the government. Total bacta output averaged 17 billion liters a year.<br>The planet-wide government was led by two canirs (chief officers) appointed by an elected council, each canir representing one of the two corporations. Because Xucphra and Zaltin were competitors, there was frequent governmental gridlock. The Ashern (Black Claw) terrorist group, which viewed the corporations as a threat, attempted to topple them. In the political confusion following the Battle of Endor, Thyferra remained neutral and profited by selling bacta to both sides. Two and a half years after Endor, the New Republic, anxious to please the Thyferran leaders, recruited the human pilots Bror Jace (from Zaltin) and Erisi Dlarit (from Xucphra) into the famous Rogue Squadron.<br>Thyferra has three spaceports.

Foreign workers, who are hired to make the bacta runs, stay in segregated areas around the spaceport. The port’s main building is a low two-story rectangle, with akonije trees growing through it and out the roof.

Xizor was more than 100 years old, with the body of a well-sculpted 30-year-old thanks to its crafting by myostim units. A Falleen, Xizor was tall with a slightly elevated, sharp reptilian ridge over his spine. His head was bald except for a long topknot and ponytail. Xizor exuded natural pheromones that made most humanoids feel instantly attracted to him; his skin color, normally a dusky green, changed with the rise of those pheromones, going from the cool into the warm spectrum of colors.<br>Xizor harbored a particular hatred for Vader. About a decade before the Battle of Hoth, Vader had established a biological weapons lab on Xizor’s planet. An accident let a tissue-destroying bacterium escape, so Vader ordered the city near the lab burned to ashes, killing 200,000 Falleen including Xizor’s entire family. Xizor, who was off-world, destroyed all records of the family tragedy so that no one would know of his personal reasons for despising Vader and his pledge to avenge the deaths. When he heard that Vader was seeking Luke Skywalker to convert him to the dark side of the Force, and that young Skywalker was Vader’s son, he plotted to have Luke killed and Vader’s plans thwarted. Xizor’s huge castle on Imperial Center was only a short walk through protected corridors to Vader’s palace. Every time Vader set foot outside his castle, Xizor had him under constant surveillance. Xizor had a number of legitimate businesses into which he funneled much of the ill-gotten gains of Black Sun. The largest of these was a shipping company, Xizor Transport Systems (XTS).<br>Because attracting females was so easy for Xizor, he quickly tired of them. But he considered Princess Leia Organa a real challenge, although he was confident he could win her over with his pheromones. Leia initiated the contact in her attempts to find out who was trying to murder Luke. At their first meeting, Leia was indeed taken with Xizor’s beauty, and she nearly let herself be seduced. But his spell over her was broken when Chewbacca interrupted their meeting and whisked Leia away. When Leia returned, she kneed Xizor in the groin, turning herself into a prisoner. Xizor had his female human-replica droid, Guri, take Leia to her locked room, then informed her that she was bait to lure Luke.<br>When Luke, Lando Calrissian, Dash Rendar, and Chewbacca broke into Xizor’s castle through its lowest levels, the prince was at first reluctant to admit that his tight security measures could have been overcome.

La bataille eut lieu à proximité de la quatrième lune de Yavin, une planète géante gazeuse .La bataille se déclencha après que des espions Rebelles eurent dérobé les plans de la nouvelle arme Impériale de destruction massive, l'Etoile Noire. Malgré la capture et le sauvetage, peu de temps après, de la princesse Leia Organa, ces plans parvinrent au Quartier Général de l'Alliance, sur Yavin 4. Mais les sauveteurs de la princesse furent suivis et l'Empire connut ainsi l'emplacement de la base Rebelle. Trente minutes standard avant que l'Etoile Noire ne se trouve à bonne distance pour pulvériser Yavin 4, les Rebelles rassemblèrent l'ensemble de leurs vaisseaux. L'enjeu était simple : la survie ou la destruction totale de l'Alliance Rebelle.<br>Le plan Rebelle dépendait de la capacité d'un seul pilote de chasseur à se faufiler dans les tranchées de l'Etoile Noire, en évitant les tirs de laser des tourelles et des chasseurs Tie, pour finalement envoyer une unique torpille à protons dans une petite fenêtre d'évacuation thermique. Cette torpille provoquerait une réaction en chaîne qui détruirait la station de combat.La bataille s'engagea plutôt mal pour les Rebelles. Si au tout début, ils purent abattre un grand nombre d'Impériaux grâce aux compétences supérieures de leurs pilotes, ils furent vite dépassés par la supériorité numérique des Impériaux. Tandis que l'Etoile Noire émergeait de la face de Yavin et se trouvait en mesure d'armer son tir sur la quatrième lune, tout semblait perdu pour l'Alliance. Mais un jeune fermier de Tatooine décida alors de désactiver son ordinateur de visée et de se fier uniquement au pouvoir de la Force. Il n'avait qu'une chance sur un million de viser juste et il le fit, marquant ainsi le début de la fin pour l'Empire. La destruction de l'Etoile Noire prouva que le colosse était vulnérable.

La bataille d'Endor signifia le début du déclin de l'Empire et donna naissance à la Nouvelle République. Cette bataille se solda par la destruction de la seconde station de combat, l'Etoile de la Mort, et la mort de Dark Vador et de l'Empereur Palpatine. Ce dernier réapparut plus tard sous forme de clone.<br>Ayant appris que l'Empire construisait une seconde Etoile Noire, encore plus puissante que la première, l'Alliance Rebelle voulut à tout prix détruire cette station de combat avant qu'elle ne soit achevée. Par ailleurs, des espions bothans apprirent que l'Empereur se rendrait personnellement en visite à bord de l'Etoile de la Mort. Il s'avéra que ces deux informations faisaient partie d'un piège que l'Empereur tendait à l'Alliance.Tandis que l'amiral Ackbar rassemblait la flotte Rebelle autour de la planète Sullust, un commando d'assaut fut envoyé pour désactiver le générateur de champ qui protégeait l'Etoile de la Mort. Ce groupe, commandé par Yan Solo, comprenait Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, les droïdes D2-R2 et Z-6PO, ainsi qu'un peloton de soldats d'élite. Ils utilisèrent une navette Impériale volée pour passer inaperçus à travers les forces Impériales et atterrir sur la lune forestière d'Endor. La synchronisation de l'opération devait être parfaite. Il fallait en effet désactiver ou détruire le générateur de champ au moment même où la flotte Rebelle émergeait de l'hyperespace. C'était la condition pour que l'attaque surprise puisse avoir lieu.Mais, malgré qu'elle ne fût pas encore \\\"achevée\\\", l'Etoile de la Mort avait un superlaser tout à fait opérationnel. De plus, une légion de stormtroopers et d'autres soldats Impériaux, chargés de défendre le générateur de champ, attendaient de pied ferme le commando Rebelle. Tandis que le groupe d'assaut livrait bataille sur la lune d'Endor, la flotte Rebelle se mit en position d'attaque mais le champ de protection était toujours opérationnel.<br>L'Empereur avait prévu que la flotte Rebelle serait cantonnée sur la face éloignée de la lune et que les chasseurs Tie parviendraient facilement à détruire ses vaisseaux. Ensuite, le superlaser de l'Etoile de la Mort pulvériserait tous les vaisseaux lourds de l'Alliance. Les Rebelles essayèrent de gagner du temps en utilisant les super destroyers Impériaux comme boucliers.Sur la lune forestière, les Ewoks apportèrent leur aide au groupe d'assaut, qui put mener sa mission avec succès. Quand les générateurs de champ furent détruits, le champ protecteur qui entourait l'Etoile de la Mort disparut. Lando Calrissian et ses chasseurs passèrent alors à l'attaque. Le <i>Faucon Millenium</i> et le X-wing de Wedges Antilles pénétrèrent dans la superstructure de la station de combat et lancèrent des torpilles à protons sur le régulateur d'énergie. Simultanément, Lando Calrissian bombarda le réacteur  principal avec des missiles à concussion. Les explosions ainsi produites déclenchèrent la destruction globale de l'Etoile de la Mort. Sans l'Empereur, le Côté Obscur perdit son pouvoir centralisant et les forces Impériales furent plongées dans le chaos.

Elle fut une réelle menace pour l'Alliance. Intelligente et efficace, impitoyable et belle, Daala avait des cheveux couleur cuivre et des yeux verts très perçants. Originaire d'un coin longtemps ignoré de la galaxie, elle devint l'une des meilleurs atouts militaires de la République.Quand elle était plus jeune, Daala eut à subir de nombreux sarcasmes, ce qui était prévisible de la part d'une culture sexiste. On l'assigna à des postes qui ne correspondaient pas à sa valeur. Comme elle était une des meilleures élèves de l'Académie Impériale de Carida, une des écoles militaires les plus exigeantes de l'Empire, elle attira l'attention du Moff Tarkin, qui fit d'elle sa protégée et son amante. Tarkin voulait que l'Empereur ignore son existence tout comme il souhaitait qu'il ne soit pas au courant d'un projet ambitieux qu'il venait d'élaborer. Faisant d'une pierre deux coups, il mit Daala à la tête de son installation logistique ultra-secrète, appelée l'installation Maw, au coeur du champ de trous noirs situé à proximité de Kessel. Il lui donna aussi le commandement de quatre destroyers stellaires et la promut au rang d'amiral. L'installation, qui employait 180 000 personnes, produisait des plans et des prototypes pour les stations de combat de type Etoile Noire, ainsi que pour les Dévastateurs de Mondes utilisés pendant la bataille contre Mon Calamari et le Destructeur de Soleils.<br>L'installation Maw resta complètement isolée pendant onze ans. Quand la première navette Impériale y arriva, Daala découvrit avec stupéfaction que ses passagers étaient Yan Solo, Chewbacca et Kyp Durron, qui venaient de s'échapper des mines d'épices de Kessel. En les interrogeant, elle apprit avec non moins de surprise que Tarkin était mort,  que les deux Etoiles Noires avaient été anéanties et que l'Empire était moribond. L'amiral décida de se venger en utilisant la puissance de son arme absolue, le Destructeur de Soleils, contre la Nouvelle République. Mais Yan s'était rallié les services de Qwi Xux, le chef du département scientifique, qui les libéra et qui se joignit à eux pour voler le seul exemplaire opérationnel de Destructeur de Soleils. Furieuse, Daala détruisit une grande partie de la flotte de Kessel, ainsi qu'une colonie sur Dantooine. Elle faillit détruire Mon Calamari mais en fut empêchée par l'amiral Ackbar.Ayant perdu deux de ses destroyers stellaires, elle battit en retraite et se prépara à détruire Coruscant, siège de la Nouvelle République. Mais Kyp Durron la repéra et lança quelques super torpilles du Destructeur de Soleils qui détruisirent un troisième destroyer stellaire et endommagèrent le vaisseau de Daala, le <i>Gorgon</i>. Les forces de la Nouvelle République l'affrontèrent ensuite à l'Installation Maw mais elle eut le temps de récupérer les plans d'armes les plus importants dans les ordinateurs avant de faire exploser l'installation. Elle s'enfuit ensuite pour continuer le combat ailleurs.Avec le <i>Gorgon</i> quasiment hors d'usage et son pouvoir diminué, l'amiral Daala essaya de regrouper les seigneurs de guerre sous la bannière Impériale. Comme son entreprise était sur le point d'échouer, elle exécuta 13 de ces seigneurs avec du gaz asphyxiant, prit le contrôle de toutes les forces Impériales et d'un super destroyer stellaire, qu'elle baptisa <i>Knight Hammer</i>. Une fois de plus, elle s'engagea contre la Nouvelle République et une fois de plus elle échoua. Elle fut à deux doigts d'y perdre la vie mais sa détermination ne faiblit pas.<br>Quelques années plus tard, Daala refit surface à la tête de la Compagnie Indépendante des Colons, un groupe de 3000 personnes qui restaient fidèles aux anciens codes. Le groupe acheta 750 millions d'hectares sur la planète Peduccis Chorios pour y vivre en toute quiétude. Ce terrain appartenait au seigneur de guerre K'iin de la Silver Unifir. Après que les dirigeants de la Nouvelle République eurent déjoué un complot ourdi par le maléfique Seti Ashgad, Daala retrouva son ancien amour perdu, Liegeus Vorn.

Condamné dès l'âge de huit ans à travailler dans les mines, ce gamin aux cheveux en bataille ne se doutait pas qu'il allait vivre une vie d'extrêmes, finissant par devenir un Chevalier Jedi après avoir été entre temps corrompu par le Côté Obscur. Une nuit, des stormtroopers vinrent expulser ses parents de la colonie Deyer dans le système Anoat. Politiquement engagés, les Durron avaient simplement exprimé leur indignation quand l'Empire avait détruit Aldérande et ses milliards d'habitants. Toute la famille fut envoyée dans l'Etablissement Pénitentiaire Impérial sur la planète Kessel, où il furent condamnés aux travaux forcés. Kyp dut extraire la précieuse épice narcotique dans des galeries où l'obscurité était totale. Zeth, le frère aîné de Kyp, fut quant à lui enrôlé dans la terrible Académie Impériale de Carida.Kyp passa donc ses jeunes années dans l'obscurité souterraine. Ses parents furent exécutés au cours d'une bataille qui se termina par la victoire du contrebandier Moruth Doole. Doole prit ensuite le contrôle de la prison et des mines. Parmi les nouveaux prisonniers, une vieille femme appelée Vima-Da-Boda repéra chez Kyp une aptitude naturelle pour la Force. Comme elle avait été Chevalier Jedi au temps de l'Ancienne République, elle put le former mais elle fut un jour emmenées par les autorités. Sept ans après la bataille d'Endor, Kyp fit la connaissance de deux nouveaux prisonniers : Yan Solo et Chewbacca, dont le vaisseau avait été abattu par Doole alors qu'ils se rendaient sur Kessel pour une mission diplomatique.Yan vit très vite que ce garçon de seize ans était doué pour la Force. Ce don s'avéra très profitable le jour où Chewbacca, plusieurs autres bagnards et lui-même furent attaqués dans la mine par les araignées géantes qui produisaient la précieuse épice. Dès lors, ils préparèrent ensemble un plan d'évasion et s'enfuirent de Kessel à bord d'un vaisseau cargo volé aux Impériaux, mais ils se retrouvèrent entraînés dans le Maw, un amas de trous noirs. La Force de Kyp leur permit de gagner la paix relative d'une installation ultra-secrète de l'armée Impériale commandée par l'amiral Daala. Leur évasion de cette installation, avec Kyp revêtu d'une armure de stormtrooper, déclencha une terrible bataille spatiale, qui eut pour résultat la destruction de presque toute la flotte de Moruth Doole.Luke Skywalker engagea Kyp à devenir un élève Jedi sur Yavin 4. En l'espace d'une semaine, il avait surpassé tous les autres initiés. Mais son impatience et sa colère faisaient de lui une proie facile pour le Côté Obscur. Le danger vint sous la forme du Seigneur de Sith Exar Kun, qui était mort depuis longtemps mais dont l'esprit encore vaillant était emprisonné dans un temple de Yavin. Kyp s'entraîna en secret avec Kun tout en croyant pouvoir maîtriser le Côté Obscur. Mais, dans un geste de vengeance, il ôta la mémoire à Qwi Xux, un ancien concepteur d'armes Impérial. Il s'associa ensuite à Kun pour récupérer une terrible arme, le Destructeur de Soleils, enfouie au coeur de la gigantesque planète gazeuse. Quand Luke Skywalker tenta d'intervenir, Kyp et Kun séparèrent son esprit de son corps, plongeant le Jedi dans un état proche de la mort.<br>Kyp pourchassa sa plus grande ennemie, l'amiral Daala, et faillit la tuer alors qu'elle s'apprêtait à attaquer Coruscant. Il essaya ensuite de retrouver son frère sur Carida, mais sans le faire exprès il incinéra la planète tout entière, détruisant ainsi l'objet de ses recherches. Plus tard, alors qu'il était sur le point de détruire le <i>Faucon Millenium</i> avec Yan Solo et Lando Calrissian à son bord, il fut libéré de l'influence d'Exar Kun par les autres élèves Jedi, qui avaient réussi à détruire l'esprit de ce dernier. Rétabli, Luke se proposa de poursuivre la formation de Kyp s'il renonçait pour toujours au Côté Obscur. Alors qu'ils étaient partis détruire un bonne fois pour toutes le Destructeur de Soleils, Luke et Kyp eurent à affronter une nouvelle fois l'amiral Daala. Au péril de sa vie, Kyp parvint à détruire à la fois le Destructeur de Soleils et un prototype d'Etoile Noire.\",\"category\":\"H\",\"references\":[\"JS\",\"DS\",\"SWCG\"]},{\"name\":\"Dutch\",\"originalName\":\"Dutch\",\"description\":\"Surnom de Jon Vander.

La Force est générée par tous les êtres vivants, elle les entoure et les pénètre de son essence. Comme la plupart des formes d'énergie, la Force peut être manipulée. Cette connaissance et une certaine prédisposition font toute la puissance des Chevaliers Jedi et des Jedi Noirs. Il existe deux côtés de la Force : le côté clair porte en lui de grandes connaissances, la paix et la sérénité de l'esprit. Le côté obscur n'est que peur, colère et agressivité.<br>Mais les deux côtés de la Force, celui de la vie et celui de la mort, font partie de l'ordre naturel. À travers la Force, un Chevalier Jedi peut avoir des visions de lieux éloignés, effectuer des tours de force incroyables et accomplir des choses à priori impossibles. La force d'un Jedi émane de la Force, mais un véritable Jedi l'utilise pour la connaissance et la défense, jamais pour attaquer. La Force est un allié puissant, quelle que soit la façon dont elle est utilisée.Il existe trois domaines principaux de manipulation de la force : le contrôle, la sensibilité et l'altération. Seuls les êtres vivants sensibles à la Force sont capables de maîtriser les techniques Jedi. Mais l'entraînement nécessaire pour atteindre le statut de Jedi est long et requiert beaucoup de patience. Le contrôle est la capacité d'un Jedi à maîtriser sa propre Force interne. Ainsi, un Jedi apprend à contrôler les fonctions de son propre corps. La sensibilité permet aux Jedi de ressentir la Force dans les choses extérieures. Les Jedi apprennent à percevoir les liens qui connectent toutes les choses entre elles. \\\"Tu dois sentir la Force autour de toi\\\", disait le Maître Jedi Yoda à Luke Skywalker. \\\"Là, entre toi... moi... cet arbre... la pierre... partout !\\\" L'altération permet à un Jedi de changer la distribution et la nature de la Force afin de créer des illusions, de déplacer des objets et de modifier la perception des autres.Un Jedi Noir n'écoute que sa colère. \\\"Si tu t'engages sur le sentier obscur, pour toujours il dominera ta destinée\\\", a déclaré Yoda pour prévenir Luke. L'Empereur Palpatine, au contraire, tenta de pousser Luke à continuer sur le chemin de la furie aveugle et de l'agressivité. \\\"Abandonne toi à la haine\\\", a-t-il conseillé à Luke. \\\"Terrasse moi de toute ta haine et ton voyage vers le côté obscur sera achevé\\\".\",\"category\":\"T\",\"references\":[\"SW\",\"ESB\",\"RJ\",\"SWRPG\",\"SWRPG2\"]},{\"name\":\"Fornax, Cinq anneaux de \",\"originalName\":\"fire rings of Fornax\",\"description\":\"Ensemble de cinq anneaux virtuels de feu intense, qui semblent entourer la planète Fornax.

Quatre millénaires avant l'avènement de l'Empire, Kun fut responsable de la morts de millions de personnes. Tué par une force Jedi qui lui était supérieure, Kun survécut en esprit. Son esprit noir s'attaqua quelques milliers d'années plus tard à Luke Skywalker et à ses élèves Jedi. <br>Kun fut initié à la Force par le Maître Vodo Siosk-Baas, sur Dantooine. Trop arrogant, le jeune Jedi fut happé par le Côté Obscur de la Force. Il utilisa l'Holocron Jedi de son maître pour connaître l'histoire des Seigneurs Noirs de Sith, tels que Freedon Nadd. Se faisant passer pour un archéologue Jedi, Kun se rendit sur Onderon pour étudier les objets Sith ayant appartenu à Nadd. Mais le Maître Jedi Arca Jeth vit que Ken menait un double jeu. Irrité, Kun partit pour la cité d'Iziz puis pour la lune de Dxun afin d'explorer l'influence de Nadd. A l'intérieur du caveau de Nadd, il fut confronté à l'esprit du Seigneur Noir, qui le mena à deux rouleaux de parchemins où étaient inscrits les grands secrets des Sith. Ces documents menèrent Kun à Korriban, une planète désertique où, avec l'aide de l'esprit de Nadd, il put avoir accès aux tombeaux des Sith.Pris de doute, Kun décida ensuite de ne pas poursuivre sa quête, mais il fut assailli par l'esprit de Nadd et faillit en mourir. L'esprit lui déclara que le seul espoir pour lui était de se convertir totalement au Côté Obscur, ce que fit Kun à contrecoeur. Dès lors, l'esprit de Nadd lui révéla les anciens récits des Sith, particulièrement ceux du Seigneur Naga Sadow, où il était question des expériences que celui-ci avait entrepris sur  la lune de Yavin IV pour donner un corps aux esprits des morts. Nadd engagea Kun à poursuivre la tâche inachevée de Sadow en espérant ainsi pouvoir bientôt jouir d'une nouvelle enveloppe charnelle.Sur Yavin 4, Kun renonça à nouveau au Côté Obscur mais fut attaqué par les Massassi, des descendants mutants des expériences alchimiques de Sadow. Ils voulurent le tuer en lui faisant subir le Sacrifice Massassi du Sang et Kun dut une nouvelle fois recourir au Côté Obscur pour sauver sa peau. Il massacra tous ceux qui s'opposaient à lui, y compris l'esprit de Nadd. Mais avant d'être détruit, l'esprit de Nadd eut le temps de prévenir deux de ses disciples, Aleema et Satal Keto, les fondateurs du Krath, secte mystique vénérant le Côté Obscur.Dans les mois qui suivirent, Kun fit construire par les Massassi d'immenses temples selon l'architecture des anciens Sith afin de pouvoir capter un maximum d'énergie Obscure. Il poursuivit également les expériences de Naga Sadow, transformant les Massassi en monstrueuses créatures mortifères. Il se rendit ensuite dans le système de l'Impératrice Teta pour détruire les derniers disciples Sith de Nadd. Il arriva au moment où des Chevaliers Jedi attaquaient la forteresse du Krath. Mais Aleema et le Jedi déchu Ulic Qel-Droma avaient survécu. Après avoir déchargé sur Aleema son pouvoir maléfique, il affronta Qel-Droma dans un terrible combat au sabre laser. Les Les amulettes Sith que les deux hommes portaient se mirent à scintiller grâce à l'énergie de la Force et les anciens Seigneurs Sith apparurent pour conférer à Kun le titre de Seigneur Noir de Sith et à Qel-Droma celui d'Apprentis Sith. Au final, ils se joignirent à Aleema pour essayer de vaincre la République et les Chevaliers Jedi.Lors d'un Grand Concile de Jedi organisé sur Deneba, le Maître Vodo Siosk-Baas se porta volontaire pour essayer de détourner son ancien élève du Côté Obscur, mais il échoua et se fit tuer par Kun. Les batailles sanglantes qui suivirent, entrées dans l'Histoire sous le nom de Guerre des Sith, firent des millions de victimes. Qel-Droma finit par trahir Exar Kun en révélant le secret de sa base sur Yavin 4. La bataille qui en résulta eut raison de la plupart des temples de la lune et détruisit le corps de Kun, mais celui-ci réussit à aspirer la force vitale de tous les Massassi et put ainsi maintenir son esprit en vie, bien qu'emprisonné dans les temples qui restaient sur Yavin.4000 ans plus tard, l'Alliance établit une base sur Yavin 4. Plus tard, Luke Skywalker ouvrit une Académie Jedi dans le Grand Temple de Yavin. L'esprit d'Exar Kun se mit dès lors à agir, en entraînant deux élèves vers le Côté Obscur. Il parvint également à contaminer Kyp Durron,  un Jedi qui semblait prometteur. Quand Luke comprit ce qui se passait, il décida d'affronter Durron. Avec l'aide de Kun, Durron attaqua son maître et utilisa l'Eclair de Force pour séparer l'esprit de Luke de son corps. Mais c'était sans compter sur les forces combinées de l'ensemble des élèves restant, qui protégèrent le corps de Luke contre la destruction puis piégèrent Kun. Ils regroupèrent leurs volonté en une seule entité de Force et étouffèrent ainsi l'esprit de Kun. L'esprit et le corps de Luke furent réunifiés et Durron libéré de l'emprise du Côté Obscur.\",\"category\":\"H\",\"references\":[\"SWCG\",\"DA\",\"DLS\",\"TSW\",\"COF\"]},{\"name\":\"Kwerve, Bidlo\",\"originalName\":\"Kwerve, Bidlo\",\"description\":\"Corellien au visage balafré avec des cheveux noirs striés de blanc.

Marr aida ensuite la Nouvelle République à retrouver les enfants depuis longtemps perdus des Jedi, car en fait il en faisait partie. Il aida aussi Luke Skywalker à localiser L'<i>Oeil de Palpatine</i>, un prototype de station de combat qui avait été mystérieusement réactivé. Cray et Nichos accompagnèrent Luke et Z-6PO au vaisseau afin de le détruire avant qu'il ne puisse exécuter son plan préprogrammé de destruction. Ils trouvèrent avec stupéfaction l'esprit d'une femme Jedi, Callista, emprisonné au coeur de l'ordinateur depuis le jour où, trente auparavant, elle avait désactivé les armes du vaisseau.L'<i>Oeil de Palpatine</i> pouvait être détruit mais il fallait que quelqu'un reste en arrière et soit anéanti avec le vaisseau.

Après sa défaite, Sadow et ses guerriers s'enfuirent à l'autre bout de la galaxie et s'installèrent sur la quatrième lune de Yavin. Là, Sadow força les Massassi à se mettre à son service. Ils bâtirent d'immenses temples en l'honneur du Seigneur Noir et le laissèrent mener sur eux des expériences terrifiantes. Au bout du compte, Naga Sadow provoqua une mutation de l'espèce et transforma les Massassi en de féroces prédateurs. Un millier d'années plus tard, Exar Kun arriva sur Yavin 4 et s'instaura maître des Massassi, les forçant à nouveau à construire des temples et des forteresses dans les jungles de la planète.Longtemps après la défaite de Kun dans la Guerre des Sith, mais bien avant la constitution de l'Empire, les Massassi privés de leur leader quittèrent Yavin 4. Ils laissèrent derrière eux leurs étranges temples, ainsi qu'un mystérieux gardien connu sous le nom de bête de la nuit. Alors que les forces Rebelles utilisaient Yavin 4 comme base, la bête se réveilla afin d'accomplir sa fonction de protecteur des temples Massassi. Avec l'aide de R2-D2, Luke Skywalker parvint à attirer la bête de la nuit dans un vaisseau de ravitaillement Rebelle et l'expédia dans l'espace.Les Massassi d'origine au service de Naga Sadow avaient une peau couleur rouille et des yeux jaune brillant. Leur chevelure foncée tombait sur leurs épaules et ils étaient dotés de caractéristiques faciales simiennes. Lorsqu'Exar Kun arriva sur Yavin 4, les Massassi étaient devenus d'immenses humanoïdes musclés à la peau écarlate et aux yeux sombres. Leurs visages ressemblaient à ceux de félins et plusieurs rangées de piquants poussaient sur leurs épaules. Quelques milliers d'années plus tard, Luke Skywalker eut une vision dans laquelle il vit les Massassi comme des humanoïdes gris vert, avec une peau douce et de grands yeux luminescents. Dans toutes leurs incarnations, les Massassi étaient de fantastiques combattants, sauvages mais rusés et capables de manipuler une grande variété d'armes avec une efficacité redoutable.

Un grand nombre de rivières, aux eaux brunes et boueuses, sillonnent ses paysages à la végétation luxuriante, grouillants de formes de vie les plus variées. Si Mimban ne fut jamais colonisée par les Circarpoussiens, l'Empire y ouvrit une exploitation minière secrète. Les mineurs vivaient dans cinq agglomérations composées de baraquements de fortune, et travaillaient à l'aide de foreuses à énergie, pourtant interdites sur les planètes habitées, car elles entraînaient des perturbations électriques dangereuses pour les vaisseaux à l'atterrissage.Il existe au moins trois peuples intelligents sur Mimban : les Mimbanites, reconnaissables à leurs yeux globuleux, et désignés sous le sobriquet de \\\"verdâtres\\\", qui mendient pour se procurer de l'alcool ; les Coway, minces créatures de couleur grise, vivant sous terre ; et une espèce sans nom, revêtue de fourrure et dotée de quatre pattes arrière et quatre avant. En outre, on attribue à une nation mystérieuse et éteinte depuis des millénaires, connue sous le nom de Thrella, la construction des centaines de cités et de temples qui émaillent l'humide surface de Mimban. Les \\\"puits des Thrella\\\", cratères d'une profondeur quasiment infinie, bordés de dalles hexagonales imbriquées les unes dans les autres, s'ouvrent souvent sur des galeries latérales appelées \\\"puits des Coway\\\", qui mènent au monde souterrain peuplé par cette espèce. Parmi la faune de Mimban, l'un des animaux les plus dangereux est un énorme ver de couleur pâle, dénommé wandrella ; son orifice buccal est entouré de taches noires, et il doit à sa stupidité de ne jamais reculer face au danger.L'Empire confia le gouvernement de Mimban au capitaine-superviseur Grammel, qui dirigeait la planète depuis des quartiers généraux installés dans une ancienne ziggourat d'une hauteur impressionnante. Le légendaire cristal de Kaiburr, qui passait pour concentrer et intensifier la Force, se trouvait au fin fond de la jungle, dans un temple dédié à une divinité locale, du nom de Pomojema. Ce puissant cristal était conservé dans une statue du dieu, sous la garde d'une créature lézardesque qui, malgré son air apathique, n'en était pas moins féroce. Quelque temps après la bataille de Yavin, Luke Skywalker et la Princesse Leia, flanqués des droïdes D2-R2 et Z-6PO, s'écrasèrent sur Mimban, alors qu'ils se rendaient à une conférence.

Les Mon Calamari et les Quarren, tous deux originaires de la planète, partagent ces cités, bien que les Quarren à face de poulpe préfèrent vivre dans l'obscurité des niveaux inférieurs. Parmi les cités les plus importantes, on peut citer La Maison Récifale, les Fonds Coraliens, Kee-Piru, la Cité de Corail, Heurkea, et la Cité d'Ecume.<br>Tout comme pour les vaisseaux construits par les Mon Cals, l'architecture et la conception de chaque cité leur donnent un aspect organique, caractérisé par des angles arrondis.

Il existe depuis une tension perpétuelle entre les Mon Calamari et les Quarrens. Dès que l'Empire révéla ses véritables intentions, les vaisseaux calamariens furent convertis en vaisseaux de guerre et les docks de construction orbitaux situés autour de Mon Calamari et de son unique lune devinrent une importante ressource de l'Alliance.<br>De nombreux Mon Cals devinrent des esclaves de l'Empire, comme le célèbre Ackbar, qui fut forcé d'être le serviteur personnel du Grand Moff Tarkin.

Six ans après la bataille d'Endor, le clone de l'Empereur utilisa ses Dévastateurs de Mondes pour attaquer la zone territoriale Sud de Mon Calamari, détruisant la majeure partie de Kee-Piru et d'Heurkea. La cité portuaire d'Hikahi fut également endommagée, affaiblissant dangereusement la capacité de production des vaisseaux formant le noyau de la flotte de l'Alliance Rebelle. Heureusement, grâce au Chevalier Jedi Luke Skywalker, les Dévastateurs furent vaincus. Un an après l'attaque, la princesse Leia Organa Solo rendit visite à l'amiral Ackbar dans sa demeure de la forêt d'arbres de mer, afin de l'amener à renoncer à l'exil qu'il s'était imposé.

Quatre siècles après la mort de Nadd, le Maître Jedi Arca décida d'épurer la planète en déplaçant la dépouille de Nadd sur la lune inhospitalière de Dxun. Cette décision indigna les disciples de Nadd, également appelés Naddistes, qui s'emparèrent de la dépouille, kidnappèrent Arca et prirent le contrôle de la cité royale. Durant le conflit, Nadd aida les dissidents par l'intermédiaire de son descendant, le roi Ommin. Un groupe de Jedi commandé par Ulic Qel-Droma réprima l'insurrection et vainquit l'esprit du Jedi Noir.Le sarcophage fut transporté en toute sécurité sur Dxun, mais avant cela Freedon Nadd avait pu corrompre l'esprit de jeunes aristocrates appelés Satal Keto et Aleema, qui devinrent des ennemis jurés des chevaliers Jedi. Quatre siècles plus tard, le Jedi Exar Kun réveilla à nouveau l'esprit de Nadd. Freedon permit à Kun de découvrir les parchemins secrets des Sith qui conduisirent le jeune homme naïf vers le monde caché de Korriban, site des restes momifiés de nombreux Seigneurs de Sith. L'esprit de Nadd réapparut alors et détruisit d'immenses cristaux qui emprisonnaient les esprits d'anciens Jedi qui s'étaient opposés aux Sith.

Malgré son immensité, elle se caractérise par une densité extrêmement faible, qui lui confère une gravité tolérable. En des temps reculés, cette planète était appelée Evocar, du nom des Evocii, peuple primitif qui l'habitait. Quand les Hutts arrivèrent, ils apportèrent aux Evocii des connaissances techniques en échange de territoires ; à la longue, ils s'approprièrent ainsi toute la planète, forçant sa population indigène à la déserter. L'Ancienne République installa les Evocii sur une lune voisine, Nar Shaddaa, mais leur sort n'y fut pas plus enviable. Une fois que les Hutts eurent totalement investi Nal Hutta, ils remplacèrent les structures qu'avaient édifiées les Evocii par leurs propres palais et temples, et allèrent jusqu'à rebaptiser la planète elle-même.Les Hutts transformèrent Nal Hutta, qui s'ornait naguère de paysages montagneux aux jungles magnifiques, en une sinistre planète envahie de marais putrides, aux eaux couvertes de détritus, entrecoupées de friches insalubres et infestées d'insectes et d'araignées. Aujourd'hui, les chasseurs circulant en swoops déciment à l'envi les populations d'oiseaux locales, vulnérables en raison de la grosseur et de la faible rapidité de ces volatiles. Les centres industriels de Nal Hutta en polluent l'atmosphère, souillée par les pluies grasses qui arrosent ses ghettos surpeuplés de squatters. Hutta et sa lune, Nar Shaddaa, constituent le centre du territoire spatial des Hutts et un nœud stratégique où transitent constamment pilotes de cargos, contrebandiers et négociants intergalactiques de tous poils. La planète est gouvernée par un conseil composé des doyens des Clans des Anciens, c'est-à-dire les plus vieilles familles hutts.

Nam Chorios, dénuée de lune, gravite autour d'une étoile du même nom, reconnaissable à sa lueur violacée. Cette planète, qui ne possède aucune mer, présente une surface couverte à l'infini de rochers déchiquetés et d'affleurements de quartz et de basalte. Les nuits y sont épouvantablement glaciales. Des chaînes de montagnes cristallines réverbèrent la lumière. Ponctuellement, des cheminées minérales, appelées tsils, s'élancent vers le ciel ; les Dix Cousines sont un ensemble de ces tsils, disposés en cercle.Quelques minuscules zones vertes indiquent les endroits que les colons sont parvenus à mettre en culture. Environ 750 ans avant la bataille de Yavin, la dynastie des Grissmath envoya sur cette planète des prisonniers politiques, et y sema des drochs, créatures insectoïdes porteuses de la maladie de la Graine de Mort, en escomptant qu'aucun déporté ne réchapperait à cette contamination. Les Grissmaths installèrent, en outre, des emplacements de canons sur Nam Chorios, pour prévenir toute intervention extérieure en faveur des détenus. Pourtant, ceux-ci, de même que leurs gardiens, survécurent en exploitant les ressources naturelles de la planète. Aujourd'hui, les nouveaux arrivants de la période post-Impériale ont opté pour les technologies modernes. La secte des Ecouteurs Théran, installée dans des canyons ou des grottes, est en charge de l'artillerie de la planète. Les habitants de vieille souche manifestent un profond respect envers ses membres, car ceux-ci possèdent des dons de guérisseurs. Toute la planète a la propriété d'intensifier la Force, qu'il y est, par conséquent, difficile de maîtriser ou de concentrer.La plus grande ville de Nam Chorios porte le nom de Hweg Shul. La flore planétaire comporte, notamment, des haies de brachniel, des buissons de loaks, des mousses de crom et de gomex, des lichens, des arbres à boutons ainsi que des plantes diverses : podhoy, bolter,  feuille-bleue, snigvine, bott et balcrabbien. D'énormes boules antigrav fixées par des câbles servent à retenir la mince couche de terre qui permet de cultiver smoor, brope, majie et nisemia. Des tours de métal font office de tuteurs pour le branswed et le topato. La faune comprend, entre autres, les espèces suivantes : blerds, gebbecks, alcopays, mikkets, narjams volants rappelant des insectes, et des cu-pas, animaux de monture aux vives couleurs, proches des tauntauns mais plus adaptés aux climats chauds. La planète est également infestée de drochs, qui s'enfouissent dans la chair de leurs victimes, en consument les forces et leur transmettent la maladie de la Graine de Mort ; toutefois, la décomposition des rayonnements solaires au travers des roches cristallines de Nam Chorios a pour effet d'affaiblir ces parasites. Certains d'entre eux, à force de se nourrir de leurs congénères, ont évolué en une espèce de la taille du chat ; appelés drochs-capitaines, ils ressemblent à des crabes et leurs yeux se situent à l'extrémité de longues tiges. La planète est riche en platine et en ivoire minéral ; on y trouve également, au cœur des collines, des spooks, ou smokies, amas de long cristaux verts et violets.<br>Pendant des années, le pouvoir politique est resté aux mains de Beldorian le Hutt et de Seti Ashgad, usurier exilé sur Nam Chorios par Palpatine, à l'époque où celui-ci occupait les fonctions de sénateur. Grâce à Dzym, droch mutant, Ashgad parvint à la jeunesse et à la vie éternelle. Callista, ex-Jedi qui avait perdu ses pouvoirs, fut emprisonnée par Beldorian quand elle arriva sur la planète. Neuf ans après la bataille d'Endor, Leia Organa Solo se rendit en secret sur Nam Chorios dans le but de rencontrer Ashgad. Celui-ci trahit sa confiance et la fit prisonnière, puis répandit la maladie de la Graine de Mort dans la majeure partie du secteur. Il avait élaboré le plan de neutraliser l'artillerie de la planète et de céder à la Loronar Corporation les droits d'exploitation des gisements de smokies.A la même époque, les forces de Moff Getelles, qui contrôlait le secteur Antéméridien, soutenues par les chasseurs CCIR de Loronar, envahissaient le secteur méridien, selon un plan orchestré par Dzym dans le but de s'échapper, lui et les autres drochs, de la planète où ils étaient bloqués depuis si longtemps. Le B-wing de Luke Skywalker, venu à la recherche de Callista, fut abattu. Leia réussit à s'évader de la forteresse d'Ashgad et à rejoindre l'ancienne Jedi. Après une série de combats, Leia tua Beldorian ; Dzym en réchappa, puis fut éliminé ainsi que ses congénères ; Moff Getelles fut mis en déroute lors de la bataille de Nam Chorios.

Avant d'être en contact avec l'Ancienne République, les Droviens étaient une espèce primitive aux mœurs tribales. Nombre d'entre eux vivent sous la dépendance d'une drogue, le zwil, qu'ils absorbent par l'intermédiaire de prises grosses comme le poing, insérées dans leurs tubes respiratoires. Les plus vastes installations portuaires de Nim Drovis se situent dans la zone franche de Bagsho, créée jadis par des colons originaires d'Aldérande. Depuis cinq ans, Nim Drovis constitue un lien entre les mondes neutres du secteur et la Nouvelle République.L'espèce indigène se caractérise par une silhouette s'alourdissant vers le bas, des tentacules terminées par des pinces et de nombreux organes sensitifs en diverses régions du corps. Les tribus Gopso'o (reconnaissables à leur coiffure tressée sur le haut de la tête) se consacrent à l'élevage des limaces ; une profonde hostilité les oppose aux Droviens. Leur architecture se caractérise par d'épais murs de pierre, des poutres en bois et une multitude de balcons.

Gravitant autour d'un soleil doré, N'zoth est un monde marqué par la sécheresse. A distance, elle est de couleur gris-bleu et apparaît entourée de nuages jaunes. Pa'aal est la principale lune de la cinquième planète du système de N'zoth. Les 2 000 étoiles de l'amas de Koornacht brillent tellement dans la nuit de N'zoth qu'il est impossible d'y apercevoir des astres plus éloignés. Ceci explique en partie que les Yévéthains s'imaginaient jadis être le seul peuple de tout l'univers.Les femelles de cette espèce ont pour nom marasi, et les mâles nitakka. Leurs enfants voient le jour dans des \\\"fûts de naissance\\\" individuels, appelés mara-nas. Sur Yévétha, le fait de tuer son prochain n'est considéré comme un crime que si la victime est d'un statut social supérieur à son assassin. Les mâles des couches supérieures de la société ont donc parfaitement le droit de faire passer les autres de vie à trépas, quelle que soit la raison de leur geste, et ne s'en privent pas. Les Yévéthains sont très ouverts aux progrès de la technologie, et acquièrent rapidement de nouvelles connaissances.Quand l'Empire s'implanta dans l'amas stellaire, les Yevetha avaient déjà colonisé onze planètes voisines de N'zoth, alors qu'ils ne disposaient pas encore d'hyperpropulseurs. Les Impériaux dotèrent la planète d'un chantier de réparation orbital (désigné sous le nom de code de Noir 15), ainsi que d'une garnison, installée au sol. Les Yévéthains, réduits en esclavage par l'occupant, apprirent beaucoup sur sa technologie en travaillant sur ses vaisseaux dans le chantier spatial.<br>Huit mois après la bataille d'Endor, l'Empire, confronté à des pertes croissantes dues à ses conflits avec la Nouvelle République, décida d'évacuer toutes les forces stationnées sur N'zoth et de détruire les installations de Noir 15. Nil Spaar, leader yévéthain, et ses troupes de choc tirèrent parti de la confusion générale pour s'emparer d'un destroyer, l'<i>Intimidator</i>, et tuer 20 000 citoyens Impériaux en dirigeant des tirs de turbolasers sur les vaisseaux d'évacuation. Spaar prit ensuite, au nom du protectorat yévétain, le contrôle du chantier de réparation et de neuf des vaisseaux amiraux qui s'y trouvaient.Nil Spaar accéda au pouvoir, en tant que vice-roi de la Ligue Duskhienne, après la mort de Kiv Truun, qui occupait jusque-là ces fonctions. Les installations de Noir 15 furent, par la suite, déplacées sur une orbite secrète. Les chantiers de surface de N'zoth devinrent le principal site de production des vaisseaux sphériques à propulseurs construits par la Nazfar Metalworks Guild. Douze ans après la bataille d'Endor, les Yévethains ayant fait, à l'époque de la Grande Purge, main basse sur toutes les colonies non humaines des bordures de l'amas stellaire, Nil Spaar revint sur N'zoth, où il fut accueilli en héros. Son vaisseau, l'<i>Aramadia</i>, atterrit à Hariz, où l'attendaient trois millions d'admirateurs, puis il fut porté en triomphe jusqu'à la capitale, Giat Nor, lieu de résidence de plus d'un million de personnes, sur les 700 millions d'habitants de la planète.Tout en haut du palais de Spaar se trouvait une nurserie privée, divisée en seize compartiments abritant des fûts de naissance. Au sol se trouvaient des grilles, permettant de recueillir le sang des sacrifices. Lors de la bataille finale de N'zoth, la flotte yévéthaine fut écrasée, car les esclaves de l'ennemi évacuèrent de leur système les vaisseaux qu'ils avaient pris à l'Empire.

Cet avertissement eut peu d'effet sur Qel-Droma, qui devint un agent du mal, assoiffé de pouvoir et enclin au délire. Au début du conflit suivant, la Guerre des Sith, Odan-Urr fut très actif mais il fut tué par Exar Kun, le nouveau Seigneur Noir de Sith. C'est en essayant de voler l'ancien Holocron Sith dans la Grande Bibliothèque Jedi qu'Exar Kun détruisit le Maître Jedi en utilisant ses pouvoirs Obscurs. Odan-Urr avait une chair grise et rêche, de minuscules yeux et de grandes dents blanches qui lui sortaient de la mâchoire. Ses mains étaient palmées et il adorait porter d'amples capes pourpres, mais il revêtait aussi fréquemment sa superbe armure pour combattre.\",\"category\":\"A\",\"references\":[\"TOJDL\",\"TSW\",\"TOJGA\",\"TOJFSE\",\"DLS\"]},{\"name\":\"Odle, Hermi\",\"originalName\":\"Odle, Hermi\",\"description\":\"C'est un être bipède de grande taille qui portait généralement des tuniques en lambeaux et se rendait fréquemment à la cour de Jabba le Hutt.

Onderon tourne autour d'un soleil jaune et possède quatre lunes aux orbites très différentes. La plus proche, Dxun, abrite un grand nombre de créatures assoiffées de sang, qui peuvent migrer sur Onderon pendant l'été lunaire, époque où les atmosphères respectives des deux mondes se chevauchent.<br>Les habitants humains d'Onderon établirent progressivement des défenses contre les monstres de Dxun, dont l'exemple le plus achevé est la ville fortifiée d'Iziz. La faune de la planète comprend une espèce originale : le féroce oiseau-dragon. Plus de 4 000 ans avant la bataille de Yavin, Freedon Nadd, Jedi du Côté Obscur, apporta avec lui sur Onderon les néfastes pouvoirs magiques de Sith. Ses opposants, qu'il expédiait en exil dans des régions sauvages de la planète, se regroupèrent et domptèrent les bêtes de Dxun. Des centaines de ces chevaucheurs de monstres créèrent leur propre royaume, et poursuivirent d'incessantes luttes contre le pouvoir d'Iziz.<br>Quatre cents ans après la mort de Nadd, la Nouvelle République établit un contact avec Onderon. Une délégation de Jedi, parmi lesquels Ulic Qel-Droma, fut envoyée sur la planète pour restaurer la paix entre les chevaucheurs de monstres et la reine Amanoa d'Iziz. Après le décès de cette dernière, sa fille, Galia prit le pouvoir, aux côtés de son amant Oron Kira, qui gouvernait l'un des royaumes des chevaucheurs de monstres. Il s'ensuivit un soulèvement des partisans de Freedon Nadd, que réprima une autre force Jedi. Au cours de la même période, Satal Keto et sa cousine Aleema, membres de la monarchie tétienne, vinrent sur Onderon pour apprendre les secrets de la magie de Sith ; puis ils constituèrent le Krath et prirent le pouvoir dans le système Tétien. A la suite du soulèvement naddiste, les Jedi édifièrent sur Onderon un avant-poste construit sur les vestiges d'un ancien vaisseau de Nadd.<br>A une époque plus tardive, alors que la Guerre de Sith s'achevait, un Jedi du Côté Obscur, Exar Kun, lança une attaque des clans guerriers de Mandalore sur Onderon, pour s'emparer de la planète et de la ville d'Iziz. Vaincus, lors d'une terrible bataille, par Oron Kira et par le capitaine Vanicus de la flotte républicaine, Mandalore et ceux qui, parmi ses compagnons, avaient survécu, trouvèrent refuge sur la lune de Dxun. Six ans après la bataille d'Endor, c'est-à-dire plusieurs millénaires après ces événements, le <i>Faucon Millenium</i> alors qu'il s'était posé sur Onderon à la suite d'une avarie, subit des dommages encore plus graves lors d'un affrontement avec l'<i>Eclipse II</i>, vaisseau amiral de l'Empereur ressuscité. Craignant pour son bébé, Anakin, la Princesse Leia Organa Solo se cacha dans la demeure du chef guerrier Modon Kira, bien protégée dans les contrées sauvages d'Onderon. Palpatine, se faisant passer pour un pèlerin en route vers le monastère de Shatoon, découvrit l'enfant et tenta de s'en approprier le corps. Mais le Jedi Empatojayos Brand l'empêcha d'exécuter son projet. Par la suite, les dirigeants de la Nouvelle République, réunis dans la forteresse de Modon Kira, rétablirent leur gouvernement galactique avec, à sa tête, Mon Mothma assistée de Leia Organa Solo.\",\"category\":\"P\",\"references\":[\"TOJ\",\"FNU\",\"DLS\",\"EE\",\"TSW\",\"EGPM\"]},{\"name\":\"Oola\",\"originalName\":\"Oola\",\"description\":\"Belle danseuse twi'lek, traitée avec cruauté par Jabba et qui meurt tragiquement sous la salle du trône du Seigneur du Crime.

Ossus, qui gravite autour de deux soleils jumeaux selon une orbite en forme de huit, était autrefois une place forte et un site d'entraînement Jedi de premier plan. Il semblerait même que cette planète vit la naissance de l'Ordre des Chevaliers Jedi. Ossus était jadis parsemée de nombreuses villes et installations de défense. Près d'une chaîne de montagnes rocheuses se trouvait un spatioport du nom de Knossa. La planète était visitée pour sa Grande Bibliothèque Jedi et ses paisibles jardins de Talla. On admire, encore aujourd'hui, les peintures rupestres aux motifs élaborés qui couvrent ses gorges escarpées. Certains monuments anciens, préservés de la ruine, abritent, entre autres, les salles de méditation des Jedi.<br>Cinq mille ans avant la naissance de Luke Skywalker, le maître Jedi Ooroo initia Odan-Urr aux voies de la Force. Celui-ci devait, par la suite, mettre son savoir en oeuvre en édifiant la Grande Bibliothèque. Un millénaire plus tard, un autre maître Jedi, Vodo-Siosk Baas, créa un centre d'entraînement sur cette paisible planète. Parmi ses élèves figuraient Nomi Sunrider, Shoaneb Culu, Tith Kark, Qrrl Toq et Dace Diath. Pendant la Grande Guerre de Sith, Exar Kun, Jedi déchu, se rendit sur Ossus, où il rallia vingt Chevaliers Jedi à la cause des Sith. Avant de repartir, il tua le maître Odan-Urr et s'empara d'un Holocron Sith, conservé dans la bibliothèque des Jedi. Plus tard, une flotte Jedi fut dépêchée d'Ossus à l'amas voisin de Cron, pour défendre la station de Kemplex Neuf, alors assiégiée. La transformation de l'amas stellaire en nova eut pour effet de détruire les forces ossiennes ; l'onde de choc qui en résultat faillit même dévaster Ossus. L'évacuation de la planète fut ordonnée et la population emporta avec elle autant de reliques de l'histoire ancienne de ce monde que possible. C'est alors que les armées de Kun et d'un Jedi corrompu du nom d'Ulic Qel-Droma investirent la planète, dans le but de la piller de ses richesses, avant qu'elle ne soit touchée par l'onde de choc. Un combat eut lieu entre Kun et Ood Bnar, maître Jedi neti ; ce dernier se transforma en arbre, de sorte de dissimuler des sabres laser, les plus anciens connus dans la galaxie.<br>Ulic, quant à lui, tua son frère Cay en duel et fut saisi d'horreur et de remors quand il comprit son geste. La plupart des Jedi quittèrent la planète juste avant l'arrivée de l'onde de choc, qui devait réduire la surface d'Ossus à un désert carbonisé. Certains des Jedi qui n'étaient pas partis, et s'étaient réfugiés, ainsi que leur famille, dans de profondes grottes, survécurent à cette catastrophe. Leurs descendants formèrent la tribu des Ysanna, Chamans-guerriers qui utilisent la Force pour orienter leurs armes primitives. Vima-Da-Boda offrit à Leia Organa Solo un sabre laser vieux de 10 000 ans, trouvé sur un site archéologique d'Ossus, huit siècles avant la naissance de la princesse. Six ans après la bataille d'Endor, Luke Skywalker, en explorant une région aride et sablonneuse de la planète, découvrit la tribu des Ysanna. Skywalker et Kam Solusar s'opposèrent aux forces de l'Exécuteur Sedriss, Jedi du Côté Obscur et  mirent au jour les sabres lasers enfouis, bien longtemps auparavant, parmi les racines du maître Ood, qui avait courageusement sacrifié sa vie pour empêcher Sedriss de s'en emparer.<br>A l'époque du départ de Skywalker, la Nouvelle République envisageait d'envoyer des archéologues explorer les ruines d'Ossus. Peu après, plusieurs guerriers de l'Empereur arrivèrent sur la planète, pour capturer trois chefs ysannas. Leurs corps étaient censés servir de matière première à l'élaboration de nouveaux clones pour Palpatine. Skywalker et ses novices Jedi suivirent les responsables de cet enlèvement et réussirent à les vaincre, sur la planète Vjun. Mais ils ne purent libérer les Ysannas, captifs d'une gangue de carbonite. Treize ans plus tard, Skywalker et Tenel Ka, en mission secrète sur Borgo Prime, réclamèrent des gemmes de corusca qui, selon eux, leur permettraient d'ouvrir une salle au trésor située sur Ossus.\",\"category\":\"P\",\"references\":[\"DE\",\"FNU\",\"DLS\",\"DE2\",\"YJK\",\"EE\",\"TSW\",\"EGPM\"]},{\"name\":\"<i>Outrider</i>\",\"originalName\":\"<i>Outrider</i>\",\"description\":\"Ce transporteur YT-2400 de la Corporation Technique Corellienne appartenant à Dash Rendar fut manifestement transformé pour les besoins de ses opérations de contrebande.

Au fil des années, il gravit les échelons pour devenir le commandant-en-second, avec le grade de capitaine. Durant la bataille d'Endor, le commandant du <i>Chimère</i> trouva la mort avec d'autres officiers et Pellaeon prit les commandes du vaisseau. En voyant la débâcle à laquelle les forces Impériales étaient soumises, il ordonna à contrecoeur aux vaisseaux Impériaux de battre en retraite.Le capitaine Pellaeon s'attacha pendant des années à regrouper, avec quelques autres, les forces restantes de l'Empire. Il désespérait de voir l'Empire dirigé par un puissant nouveau leader jusqu'au jour où le Grand Amiral Thrawn réapparut et choisit de faire du <i>Chimère</i> son vaisseau amiral. Thrawn écoutait volontiers les avis du capitaine mais n'en tenait pas compte. Pellaeon commanda le <i>Chimère</i> durant la bataille de Sluis Van. Agissant sous les ordres de Thrawn, il engagea les services de Niles Ferrier et de Mara Jade pour localiser la flotte dreadnaught <i>Katana</i> qui avait disparu depuis longtemps. Pellaeon savait que le plus grand problème de Thrawn était de surestimer les compétences et la loyauté de ceux qui l'entouraient. Au moment où la bataille de Bilbringi tournait au désavantage des Impériaux, Rukh, le garde du corps noghri de Thrawn, tua l'amiral.

Formé par le Maître Jedi Arca Jeth en compagnie de son jeune frère Cay sur Arkania, planète minière, Ulic Qel-Droma devint très vite un expert au sabre laser. Déjà à l'époque, son assurance et son impétuosité le firent passer pour arrogant aux yeux de certains. Quand il jugea qu'ils étaient prêts, le Maître Arca envoya les deux frères et Tott Doneeta, un autre élève, sur Onderon pour qu'ils aident à mettre un terme à la violente guerre civile qui opposait les habitants de la ville des meneurs de troupeaux.Mais la ville fortifiée d'Iziz était encore tout imprégnée du Côté Obscur quelque 400 ans après la chute de Freedon Nadd, Seigneur Noir de Sith. Après un début difficile, Arca arriva et aida les dresseurs de bêtes à remporter la victoire. Peu après, le Jedi trouva la crypte de Freedon Nadd, ce qui déclencha le soulèvement des loyalistes de Nadd, qui kidnappèrent le Maître Arca et s'emparèrent d'Iziz. Ulic mena un contingent de Jedi pour libérer son maître et tua le roi Ommin, descendant direct de Nadd, ce qui mit fin au soulèvement. Durant cette révolte, Ulic tomba amoureux de Nomi Sunrider, qui était également Jedi, mais il fut séparé d'elle quand on le nomma Gardien du système de l'Impératrice Teta.Dans les mois qui suivirent, deux prétendants au trône qui avaient été exposés aux enseignements Sith par l'esprit de Freedon Nadd créèrent le Krath, un groupe de sorciers ayant recours au Côté Obscur. Le Krath incita les planètes du système Teta à se mettre en guerre. Ulic décida de s'infiltrer dans le groupe pour apprendre leurs secrets. Aleema et Satal Keto, les fondateurs du Krath, entrèrent dans le jeu d'Ulic mais Satal finit par le trahir en lui injectant un poison à action lente qui l'empêcherait de retourner du Côté Lumineux. Ulic survécut ensuite à une tentative d'assassinat de Satal et vit Nomi s'échapper quelques heures seulement avant qu'il ait accepté de la tuer pour prouver sa loyauté envers le Krath. Nomi et Cay Qel-Droma ne parvinrent pas à soustraire Ulic à l'influence du Krath. Furieux, Ulic tua Satal.Aleema lui donna la moitié d'une amulette Sith que l'esprit de Freedon Nadd avait confiée à Satal. Ulic franchit alors une étape supplémentaire dans sa transformation. Il se retrouva ensuite confronté à un autre Jedi déchu, Exar Kun. Tandis qu'ils étaient engagés dans un combat au sabre laser, ils furent visités par les esprits des anciens Seigneurs Sith qui leur révélèrent que Kun deviendrait le nouveau Seigneur Noir de Sith, avec Qel-Droma en tant que premier assistant.Des années plus tard, Ulic réapparut avec d'immenses pouvoirs Obscurs et une grande armée assoiffée de sang. Au service d'Exar Kun, il pilla et détruisit des régions entières de la galaxie. Les chevaliers Jedi et la République virent en lui leur principal ennemi et engagèrent une série de batailles connues sous le nom de Guerre des Sith.

Cette planète est peuplée de Twi’leks, espèce humanoïde caractérisée par deux longues queues situées derrière la tête. Ces appendices préhensibles, auxquel les Twi’leks donnent le nom de lekku, leur servent à communiquer par des gestes délicats, bien que ces êtres soient aussi doté d'une langue, le twi’leki.Ryloth, planète montagneuse, présente une rotation tellement lente qu'elle s'effectue en un temps égal à une révolution effectuée autour de son soleil. Par conséquent, l'une de ses faces demeure toujours exposée à la lumière. Seule la zone crépusculaire située entre les deux faces est habitable. Les considérables perturbations qui agitent la mince atmosphère de Ryloth contribuent à répartir la chaleur sur l'ensemble de cette région, où les Twi'leks vivent dans des habitations troglodytes creusées dans les montagnes. Des éoliennes alimentent en énergie leur industrie primitive. Pour subvenir à leurs besoins alimentaires, ils pratiquent la culture des champignons et l'élevage de rycrits, animaux apparentés aux bovins. Les habitants de Ryloth vivent principalement du commerce d'une épice, appelée ryll, dont la consommation entraîne une accoutumance ; ils exportent aussi leurs femelles, fort recherchées pour leurs talents de danseuses.<br>L'état twi'lek s'organise autour d'un gouvernement clanique composé de cinq membres, auxquels incombent toutes les décisions politiques. Quand l'un d'entre eux décède, les quatre autres sont envoyés en exil sur la face de la planète exposée au soleil (région appelée Terres Brillantes) et un nouveau gouvernement est mis en place. Galactic Exotics, importante entreprise twi'lek, est à l'origine du développement des cultures vivrières sur Belsavis. C'est également sur Ryloth que se trouve le siège de SchaumAssoc., agence de publicité pionnière dans le domaine des médias et des relations publiques au sein du Secteur Corporatif.En des temps reculés, un modeste avant-poste fut créé sur Ryloth, pour servir de centre d'entraînement et de point de ravitaillement en carburant ; dépendant de l'Empire, il était toutefois souvent utilisé par des contrebandiers. Tarkin, alors commandant, décida d'en faire une base importante. Bib Fortuna, majordome de Jabba le Hutt, fut parmi les premiers à négocier le ryll au-delà des limites du système, ce qui éveilla l'attention de l'Empire et attira des trafiquants d'esclaves sur Ryloth. Fortuna, condamné à mort sur la planète, parvint à s'en évader et y revint par la suite accomplir sa vengeance, appuyé par une armée de malfrats à la solde de Jabba. Cette expédition punitive se traduisit par l'incendie de sept villes de Ryloth ; Jabba en profita pour s'emparer d'esclaves et de richesses, tandis que Fortuna libérait Nat Secura, dernier fils d'une grande lignée de Twi'leks. Fortuna élabora un plan pour revenir sur la planète et s'accaparer le pouvoir conjointement avec Secura, lorsque se présenterait une occasion propice. Peu avant la bataille d'Endor, Fortuna réduisit en esclavage la fille d'un chef de clan, appelée Oola, pour en faire une danseuse au service de Jabba. Tol Sivron, scientifique de la station Maw, Nawara Ven, pilote dans l'escadron Rogue et le Chevalier Jedi Tott Doneeta naquirent sur Ryloth.Quand la Nouvelle République eut repris Coruscant, l'escadron Rogue fut chargé d'une mission sur Ryloth, pour y chercher du ryll kor qui, mélangé à du bacta, servait à produire le rylca, remède contre le virus de Krytos. Les Rogues atterrirent sur le spatioport de Kala'uun, situé sur une des montagnes désignées sous le nom des Cinq Solitaires. Par la suite, le chef de guerre twi'lek Tal'dira et ses pilotes, volant à bord de vaisseaux hybrides X-TIE appelés Chir'daks, c'est-à-dire Graines de mort, devaient se joindre à eux.\",\"category\":\"P\",\"references\":[\"SWSB\",\"COF\",\"COJ\",\"TOJ\",\"CSSB\",\"TJP\",\"XW\",\"SWAJ\",\"KT\",\"BW\",\"EGPM\"]},{\"name\":\"Sélonia\",\"originalName\":\"Selonia\",\"description\":\"L'un des cinq mondes habités du système Corellien.

Les cieux de ses nombreux mondes urbanisés sont illuminés par les lumières multicolores d'innombrables panneaux de publicité. Il est possible d'y trouver une sélection incroyable de marchandises, et des touristes viennent des quatre coins de la galaxie pour y acheter des produits rares.<br>L'ASC, constituée de dizaines de sociétés, est dirigée par les cinquante-cinq membres du Plateau Direx, qui dépendent eux-mêmes de l'ExO. L'ASC dispose d'une exclusivité de droits lui permettant d'exploiter à sa guise les ressources du secteur. En général, l'ASC épuise les ressources d'une planète, puis se met au travail sur un autre monde, n'hésitant pas à utiliser des esclaves et à polluer gravement l'environnement. Comme il n'existe aucune concurrence interne, l'ASC peut fixer le prix des marchandises bien au-dessus de leur valeur réelle. Les commerçants du secteur n'acceptent que les Bons Monétaires de l'Autorité et le vertex cristallin.Une partie des énormes profits de l'ASC était secrètement reversée à l'Empereur Palpatine, afin d'éviter que l'Empire ne vienne jouer un rôle direct dans les opérations du secteur. De ce fait, l'ASC constitua ses propres forces militaires, comme la Police de Sécurité (appelée Espos) et une petite flotte un peu archaïque. Les planètes du Secteur Corporatif comprennent Ammuud, Bonadan, Roonadan, Etti IV, Kalla, Kail, Kir, Orron III, Duroon, Mytus VII, Gaurick, Rampa, Mall’ordian, Reltooine, Knolstee, Mayro et les colonies des Trianii sur les mondes de Fibuli, Ekibo, Pypin et Brochiib. Les Trianii, des êtres aux caractéristiques félines, se sont férocement opposés à l'annexion de leurs mondes par le Secteur Corporatif, et de nombreuses batailles entre les deux camps se déroulèrent dans le Bras de Tingel. Un armistice fut récemment déclaré, après trois ans de combats intensifs.Constitué à l'origine à l'époque de l'Ancienne République, le Secteur Corporatif n'était autrefois qu'un groupe de quelques centaines de systèmes dénués de vie intelligente. Les corporations autorisées à travailler dans ce secteur pouvaient acheter des régions entières d'espace, mais étaient surveillées de près par la République. Cependant, au fur et à mesure de l'augmentation du pouvoir de l'Empereur, plusieurs corporations alliées à Palpatine parvinrent à le convaincre d'étendre la taille du secteur à 30 000 étoiles. Onze espèces intelligentes furent découvertes dans ces nouvelles régions, mais ce fait fut habilement dissimulé. L'ASC fut constituée afin d'organiser les opérations du secteur, ce qui marqua le début de l'ère moderne du Secteur Corporatif.Yan Solo et Chewbacca accomplirent plusieurs exploits légendaires dans le Secteur Corporatif, comme l'évasion de la célèbre colonie pénitentiaire de Star's End.

Ils formèrent un groupe appelé le Krath, qui utilisa la magie Sith et la force militaire pour conquérir au plus vite le système. Sur la plaza de la capitale, Cinnagar, on exécuta en public des mineurs de carbonite qui s'étaient révoltés.

Dans les mois qui suivirent, Satal Keto fut tué et un commando Jedi essaya de libérer Qel-Droma de la citadelle, mais il avait succombé au Côté Obscur et souhaita rester à Cinnagar. Qel-Droma joignit ses forces à celles du Seigneur Sith Exar Kun et les deux hommes essayèrent de donner naissance à un nouvel Age d'Or des Sith.

C'est le centre galactique de la production de bacta. Monde vert et blanc couvert de forêts des pluies d'une humidité insupportable, Thyferra ne présente qu'une faible inclinaison. Elle a deux lunes, dépourvues d'air et inhabitées. Vers le milieu de son existence, l'Ancienne République établit ses premiers contacts avec Thyferra. Ceci eut pour effet d'apporter une révolution technologique aux Vratix, auxquels la colonisation de planètes voisines n'avait pas permis un développement important.Les Vratix inventèrent le fluide guérisseur connu sous le nom de bacta, qui s'obtient à partir d'une plante cultivée sur la planète, l'alazhi, mélangée à une substance chimique, le kavam. Les Vratix étendirent cette industrie, rentable au plus haut point, à de nombreux autres mondes. L'Empire gagnant en puissance, deux grandes entreprises productrices de bacta, Xucphra et Zaltin, négocièrent un contrat d'exclusivité avec les Impériaux, qui leur réservait un quasi-monopole sur ce marché. Le conglomérat formé par ces deux sociétés, dont dépendaient dorénavant 95 % de la production galactique, prit le nom du Cartel du Bacta. Ces entreprises, contrôlées par des humains, dominèrent pendant longtemps les affaires de la planète, dont elles dirigeaient le gouvernement. La production totale annuelle de bacta avoisinait, en moyenne, 17 milliards de litres par an.Le gouvernement planétaire avait à sa tête deux \\\"canirs\\\", nommés par un conseil élu et représentant chacun l'une des deux entreprises du cartel. Les situations de blocage politique étaient fréquentes, en raison de la concurrence que se livraient Xucphra et Zaltin. Un groupe terroriste baptisé Ashern (Griffe noire), voyant une menace dans le monopole du cartel, tenta de renverser les canirs. Dans la confusion politique qui suivit la bataille d'Endor, Thyferra resta neutre, ce qui lui permit de vendre du bacta aux deux forces en présence. Deux ans et demi après Endor, la Nouvelle République, désireuse de se gagner la faveur du gouvernement thyferrien, incorpora deux pilotes humains, Bror Jace (qui travaillait pour Zaltin) et Erisi Dlarit (au service de Xucphra), au célèbre escadron Rogue.Thyferra possède trois spatioports, dont le plus important, appelé Zalxuc, fut rebaptisé Xucphra, parce que l'ex-chef des services de renseignements Impériaux, Ysanne, avait pris le contrôle de l'entreprise du même nom. Devenue chef de l'état, Ysanne favorisa cette société au détriment de Zaltin. Les travailleurs étrangers, employés à la fabrication du bacta, sont parqués dans des sortes de ghettos, autour du spatioport. Le principal bâtiment de Xucphra est une construction rectangulaire de faible hauteur ; des arbres akonije poussent à l'intérieur, et en traversent même le toit. Si la récolte de l'alazhi et la synthèse du kavam s'effectuent essentiellement sur Thyferra, des dizaines d'autres mondes, notamment Qretu-Cinq, en produisent dans toute la galaxie.Après la prise de Borleias par l'escadron Rogue, Bror Jace fut rappelé sur Thyferra, car l'un de ses proches était gravement malade. Sur l'information d'un espion, le croiseur Interdictor <i>Vipère Noire</i>, en opération près de Thyferra, attira son X-wing en dehors de l'hyperespace et le détruisit. Selon toute vraisemblance, Jace trouva la mort lors de cette attaque. (Son décès présumé devait faire les gros titres des journaux.) Après la capture de Coruscant, la Nouvelle République devint particulièrement dépendante de la production de bacta, nécessaire au traitement du virus Krytos. Cette maladie avait en effet été propagée par Isard, qui souhaitait s'accaparer le monopole de la fabrication du médicament, pour accéder à la fortune et au pouvoir. Une impitoyable Guerre du Bacta s'ensuivit, au cours de laquelle l'escadron Rogue, agissant indépendamment de la Nouvelle République, livra un combat acharné contre Isard. Les hostilités se soldèrent par la victoire des Rogues.

Alors qu'ils cherchaient de l'aide, les parents de Cindel furent capturés par une créature appelée le Borra et emmenés dans le repaire, creusé dans une falaise, du monstrueux géant Gorax.Cindel et Mace se mirent à chercher de la nourriture mais Cindel tomba malade. Ils furent secourus par un Ewok appelé Deej, qui les emmena dans son village. La femme de Deej soigna Cindel et la guérit. Cindel devint amie avec le plus jeune fils de Deej, un Ewok espiègle appelé Wicket W. Warrick. Un soir, Mace décida de partir à la recherche de leurs parents et persuada Cindel de l'accompagner, mais ils furent également capturés par le Borra. Ils furent secourus le lendemain matin par la famille de Deej, et apprirent que leurs parents étaient aux mains du Gorax. Les Ewoks entreprirent alors d'aller délivrer Jeremitt et Catarine.Plusieurs mois plus tard, Wicket et Cindel retournèrent au village ewok, qui subissait une attaque de maraudeurs humanoïdes, lesquels avaient également atterri par accident sur Endor quelques années auparavant. Cindel assista, impuissante, à la mort de sa mère et de son frère. Elle essaya de trouver son père, mais le roi maraudeur Terak et la reine sorcière Charal l'avaient déjà capturé. Il fut tué en essayant de prévenir sa fille du danger qui la menaçait et en tentant de fuir lui-même.Cindel et Wicket furent capturés, s'enfuirent plusieurs fois et durent faire face à de terrifiants dangers. Une créature appelée Teek les emmena à son maître, un ermite appelé Noa qui avait aussi été forcé d'atterrir sur Endor. Cindel fut à nouveau capturée, puis emmenée au château du roi Terak et enfermée dans un cachot avec des prisonniers ewoks.

Ils apprirent au passage beaucoup de choses sur les technologies utilisées par l'Empire.Après le départ de l'Empire, les Yévéthains entamèrent un processus qu'ils appelèrent la Deuxième Naissance, en créant plus d'une douzaine de colonies et en restaurant plusieurs vaisseaux Impériaux capturés. La Ligue Duskhan s'appropria l'Amas tout entier, malgré le fait que dix-sept autres espèces vivaient sur certains de ses mondes. Douze ans après la bataille d'Endor, la flotte des Yévéthains élimina toutes les colonies étrangères situées en bordure de l'Amas, purifiant fanatiquement ces \\\"infections\\\" au cours d'une série d'attaques appelée la Grande Purge. Le Chef d'Etat Leia Organa Solo envoya la Cinquième Flotte de la Nouvelle République dans l'Amas afin de dissuader les Yévéthains de tenter d'étendre leur territoire et une guerre amère s'ensuivit.\",\"category\":\"Z\",\"references\":[\"BTS\",\"SOL\",\"TT\"]},{\"name\":\"Yan Solo\",\"originalName\":\"Solo, Han\",\"description\":\"Le contrebandier et joueur qui renonce un jour à sa carrière de hors-la-loi pour devenir un des plus grands héros de l'Alliance tout en restant une de ses figures les plus contradictoires.

Ses deux calottes polaires, couvertes de glace, bordent d'immenses toundras aux tons verts et bruns, séparées, à l'équateur, par une chaîne de montagnes violettes. Yavin 8 possède peu de grandes étendues d'eau ; toutefois, de vastes nappes phréatiques s'étendent sous le permafrost, créant de petites zones marécageuses pendant la saison estivale.<br>Environ 54 millions de Melodies, humanoïdes amphibiens doués d'intelligence, vivent dans les grottes et les lacs des régions équatoriales situées près des montagnes, dans la partie la plus chaude de la planète. Ces êtres naissent sur la terre puis, devenus adultes, adoptent un habitat aquatique. Leurs pattes se transforment en queue et leurs poumons en branchies, lors de la Cérémonie de la Métamorphose. Celle-ci se déroule, quand ils atteignent l'âge de vingt ans, dans une mare peu profonde tapissée d'une espèce d'algue inconnue ailleurs, qui produit de l'oxygène. Les Melodies sont, au cours de leur métamorphose, qui peut durer des semaines, dans l'impossibilité de quitter leur mare, ce qui les rend particulièrement vulnérables face aux nombreux prédateurs vivant sur la planète. Etant donné l'incapacité des individus adultes de sortir de leur milieu aquatique, ce sont les jeunes Melodies qui assurent l'essentiel des primitives fonctions de leur société.<br>La faune de la planète, très riche, comprend des poissons à dos d'argent ainsi que de nombreuses espèces d'herbivores vivant dans des terriers, et les animaux carnivores qui s'en nourrissent, tels que les lopers et les saute-mousse. On observe, dans les toundras et les zones montagneuses, dix-sept espèces d'autres herbivores, parmi lesquels le wolbak, le dysart, le dontopod et le songbuk. Les prédateurs de ces régions sont, notamment, le reel, sorte de serpent, l'ursod, capable de changer de couleur, le raith, espèce de rongeur, l'avril volant, le funambule serpentin et un arachnide, la purella.<br>Environ quatre millénaires avant la bataille de Yavin, des Massassi, venus de Yavin 4, vinrent sur Yavin 8 afin de chercher de l'aide pour leurs enfants, que le Jedi du Côté Obscur Exar Kun avait enfermés, par magie, dans un globe doré. Mais, les Melodies s'avérant incapables de leur porter secours, les Massassi gravèrent leur triste histoire dans les rochers du mont Sistra, espérant ainsi que quelqu'un pourrait, un jour, briser le sortilège. Dix-huit ans après la bataille d'Endor, Anakin Solo et son élève Tahiri arrivèrent sur Yavin 8, pour accompagner leur amie Lyric à sa Cérémonie de la Métamorphose, qui devait se tenir sur cette même montagne. Après y avoir affronté de dangereux prédateurs, ils découvrirent l'ancienne supplique des Massassi. Quand ils repartirent, ils emmenèrent avec eux une petite Melodie, Sannah, qui devait suivre l'enseignement de l'académie Jedi de Yavin 4.\",\"category\":\"P\",\"references\":[\"GG2\",\"JJK\",\"EGPM\"]},{\"name\":\"Yavin 13\",\"originalName\":\"Yavin 13\",\"description\":\"Treizième lune de la planète Yavin.

Le vaste océan qui s'étend sur la quasi-totalité de son hémisphère sud cause la présence de brouillard et d'occasionnelles tempêtes dans ses zones arides. Les Sliths sont des serpents aux mœurs nomades, sillonnant le désert de nuit, en quête de petites proies qu'ils saisissent à l'aide de leurs crochets venimeux. Quant aux Gerbs, apparentés au lapin, ils sont dotés de très grandes oreilles, sensibles au moindre son, et de griffes métalliques qui leur permettent de fouir le sol. Le reste de la faune de Yavin 13 se compose essentiellement d'une grande variété d'insectes, de lézards du crépuscule, d'une espèce de serpent dont la peau, qui brûle en permanence, attire le soleil, et de plus de soixante types de tripions, animaux proches du scorpion.

Les ysalamari vivent dans les branches des arbres riches en métaux de Myrkr. Leurs griffes poussent directement dans les branches, ce qui les rend difficiles à décrocher de leur perchoir. Un seul ysalamari peut générer une bulle de 10 mètres de diamètre dans laquelle la Force n'existe pas. Ceux qui les ont étudiés ont émis une théorie expliquant que les ysalamari repoussent la Force comme une bulle d'air repousse l'eau. A l'intérieur de cette bulle, un utilisateur de la Force ne peut pas faire appel à ses pouvoirs ni manipuler la Force.Les plans du Grand Amiral Thrawn visant à renverser la Nouvelle République impliquaient l'utilisation des dociles ysalamari. Il ordonna à des ingénieurs Impériaux de construire des réseaux de tuyaux capables de supporter et de nourrir ces créatures, afin qu'elles puissent être ôtées de leurs branches et transportées loin de leur planète. Les supports nutritifs furent conçus de manière à pouvoir être portés par Thrawn et ses hommes, afin de servir de systèmes de défense mobiles contre les Jedi.

Le modèle original Mark I fut conçu comme chasseur atmosphérique qui pouvait être adapté au voyage spatial. Ces appareils munis d'ailes à géométrie variables avec des doubles propulseurs ont un cockpit qui offre un large champ de vision. Ils sont généralement armés de triples blasters sur chaque aile. Dans les plus récents modèles de Chasseurs de Têtes, les ailes à géométrie variable étaient remplacées par des ailes fixes, et la maniabilité fut maintenue grâce à l'ajout de réacteurs de manoeuvre. La verrière du cockpit était plus lourdement blindée et les afficheurs holographiques tactiques furent améliorés. Les plus fréquentes modifications consistaient à remplacer les systèmes d'armement ou à gonfler les propulseurs pour gagner en vélocité. L'Alliance Rebelle utilisait nombre de Z-95 Chasseur de Têtes pour les missions d'entraînement.<br>Yan Solo pilota un Z-95 Mark I lorsqu'il commandait les forces de défenses d'une base de recherches hors-la-loi contre les chasseurs des Autorités du Secteur Corporatif.

Some of the largest blasters come with shield generators and targeting computers, and require a crew to operate.\",\"picture\":\"BLAS.jpg\",\"category\":\"W\",\"references\":[\"SW\",\"ESB\",\"RJ\",\"SWRPG\",\"SWRPG2\"],\"topic\":\"technology/weapons/personal/blas/\"},{\"name\":\"blaster rifle\",\"originalName\":\"blaster rifle\",\"description\":\"One of the standard arms carried by stormtroopers, the blaster rifle fires tightly focused particle beams and is one of the most powerful hand-held weapons available.

Gavin Darklighter is tall, with brown hair. He was a 16-year-old Tatooine farm boy when Wedge Antilles pushed for his inclusion in the Rogue Squadron over the objections of General Salm. Rogue Leader’s faith in his young recruit was quickly rewarded when Darklighter’s simulator test scores put him near the top of his class. He fought at Chorax and Hensara III without incident or distinction. During a night raid by Imperial stormtroopers at Rogue Squadron’s hidden base on Talasea, he was seriously wounded by blaster fire but miraculously survived. Later, he participated in the retaliatory strikes against the Imperial bases at Vladet and both times at Borleias.<br>Darklighter was with other Rogue members when they went on a reconnaissance mission to Coruscant to get a feel for the general mood of the alien population prior to an Alliance invasion. There was no way to prepare for what the Rogues found in one of the alien quarters, Invisec. At the Azure Dianoga cantina he made the mistake of rejecting the advances of Asyr Sei’lar, a female Bothan. Brought before the Alien Combine on charges of bigotry, he narrowly escaped death at the combine's hands, then by the squadron of stormtroopers that subsequently raided the combine’s hideout.<br>During that battle, Sei’lar and the combine members realized that Darklighter and the other Rogues were not their foes, so they joined forces against the Empire. Their first attempt to bring down Coruscant’s shields ended in dismal failure at the Palar warehouse. As they were about to switch remanufactured memory cores, their team was assaulted by stormtroopers. When they regrouped, Darklighter came up with the idea of “taking the planet by storm,” creating a tremendous thunderstorm and using the electrical charges from the lightning strikes to short out the power system.

Dathomir is inhabited by the Witches of Dathomir, a group of Force-sensitive women who ride fearsome rancors. The planet is covered with a wide variety of terrain including mountains, deserts, purple savannas, and forests of 80-meter trees and vines bearing hwotha berries. Indigenous life includes flying reptiles, piglike rodents, long whuffa worms, burra fish, and rancors. Semi-intelligent, two-legged reptiles live in the desert and call themselves the Blue Desert People. Humans came to Dathomir when a group of illegal arms manufacturers were exiled to the planet by the Jedi Knights. Several generations later, a rogue Jedi named Allya was also exiled to Dathomir. She began to teach the Force to the planet’s inhabitants and to her descendants, who also learned to tame the wild rancors. Nearly 400 years before the Battle of Yavin, the two-kilometer Jedi academy ship <i>Chu’unthor</i> crashed in a Dathomir tar pit. Jedi sent to recover the crashed ship were repulsed by the witches. Different clans of these witches (Singing Mountain, Frenzied River, and Misty Falls) were formed, including a group of dark siders calling itself the Nightsisters. Life among the clans followed a pattern of female dominance, and males were largely used as slaves for work or breeding.<br>Imperial forces constructed orbital shipyards and a penal colony on Dathomir’s surface. But after Emperor Palpatine learned the power of the Nightsisters’ leader, Gethzerion, he ordered all the prison’s ships destroyed to prevent her from leaving the planet. The stranded Imperials at the prison were then enslaved by Gethzerion and the other Nightsisters. Four years after the Battle of Endor, Han Solo won the planet in a high-stakes sabacc game from Warlord Omogg, who claimed it had been in her family for generations. Han’s subsequent adventures on the planet resulted in the destruction of both the Nightsisters and the forces of Warlord Zsinj. About 15 years after the Battle of Endor, a new order of Nightsisters based in the Great Canyon emerged.

The crime of the politically active parents: speaking out against the Empire’s destruction of Alderaan and its billions of inhabitants. Kyp and his parents were sent to the Imperial Correctional Facility on the planet Kessel where they were pressed into slave labor, mining the powerful drug called glitterstim spice from pitch-black tunnels.

Still, in an act of vengeance, he removed the memories from the mind of reformed Imperial weapons developer Qwi Xux.

Killed by an overwhelming force of Jedi, the dark spirit of Exar Kun survived across the vastness of time to challenge Luke Skywalker and a new group of Jedi trainees.<br>Kun was tutored in the ways of the Force on Dantooine by Master Vodo Siosk-Baas. The proud Jedi pushed himself hard, but he was pulled to the dark side of the Force and secretly used his master’s Jedi Holocron to learn about past Dark Lords of the Sith, such as Freedon Nadd. Posing as a Jedi archaeologist, Kun traveled to Onderon to examine Nadd’s Sith artifacts. Jedi Master Arca Jeth saw through Kun’s lies, and an angry Kun left for the city of Iziz and then the Dxun moon to explore Nadd’s influence. Inside Nadd’s tomb he was confronted by the spirit of the Dark Lord himself and was led to two scrolls that contained great Sith secrets. These scrolls in turn led Kun to the desolate planet of Korriban, where, with the help of Nadd’s spirit, he gained access to the Sith tombs.<br>Kun had second thoughts and tried to back out, but was felled by Nadd’s spirit in an attack that left him near death. The only hope, the spirit proclaimed, was to fully embrace the dark side, and however reluctantly, Kun did. In the time that followed, Nadd’s spirit filled him with tales, especially those of the ancient Sith Lord Naga Sadow and the experiments Sadow had performed on the moon of Yavin 4 to give flesh to the spirits of the dead. Nadd told Kun that he must complete Sadow’s work and give Nadd a new body.<br>On Yavin 4, Kun again renounced the dark side, but was attacked by the Massassi, mutated descendants of Sadow’s alchemy. They prepared him for death in a Massassi Blood Sacrifice, and Kun again turned to the dark side to save his life. He slaughtered all who would oppose him, including Nadd’s spirit, but not before it cried out a warning to two other followers, Aleema and Satal Keto, founders of the dark side mystical sect, the Krath.<br>In the months that followed, Kun had the Massassi build huge temples of an ancient Sith design to focus great dark-side energies. He also continued Naga Sadow’s experiments, turning the Massassi into monstrous creatures of death. Then he headed for the Empress Teta system to destroy Nadd’s final Sith followers. He arrived as Jedi Knights were attacking the Krath stronghold. But Aleema and fallen Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma survived. Blasting Aleema with dark-side power, he and Qel-Droma engaged in a blistering lightsaber duel. Sith amulets that both men wore began to glow with energy and ancient Sith Lords appeared and bestowed the title of Dark Lord of the Sith on Kun, and the title of Sith Apprentice on Qel-Droma. Eventually they and Aleema joined forces to try to bring down the Republic and the Jedi Knights.<br>At a Great Council of Jedi convened on Deneba, Master Vodo Siosk-Baas volunteered to try to turn his former student from the dark side, but Kun slew his master. The bloody battles that ensued, known for all time as the Sith War, resulted in millions of deaths. In the end, Qel-Droma betrayed Exar Kun, revealing the secret of Kun’s power base on Yavin 4. The resulting battle leveled most of the moon’s temples and destroyed Kun’s body, but he drained the life force from every Massassi, an act that kept his spirit alive but trapped in the remaining Yavin temples.<br>Some 4,000 years later, the Rebel Alliance briefly established a base on Yavin 4.

He enlisted one promising Jedi, Kyp Durron, until Skywalker saw what was happening and confronted Durron. With the help of Kun, Durron attacked his teacher and used dark-force lightning to separate Skywalker’s spirit from his body. But Kun didn’t reckon on the combined strength of the remaining students, who protected Skywalker’s body from destruction, then set a trap for Kun.

Mimban was never colonized by the Circarpousians, but the Empire secretly established a mining operation on the planet. The miners lived in five makeshift towns and worked with energy drills, illegal on populated worlds because their harmful electrical fallout creates a hazard for incoming spaceships.<br>There are at least three intelligent Mimban species: large-eyed Mimbanites, derogatorily called “greenies,” who beg in the mining towns for alcohol; the thin, gray Coway, who live underground; and an unnamed furry species with four legs and four arms. A mysterious, long-extinct species known as the Thrella are believed to have built hundreds of temples and cities that dot the damp surface of Mimban. “Thrella wells,” near-bottomless shafts lined with interlocking hexagonal stones, often have side passages called Coway shafts leading to the Coways’ underground world.

Raw ores used in construction are mined by the Quarren (who can breathe both air and water) from domed cities on the ocean floor. A permanent history of every planetary event is maintained by a community of meter-long, bivalve mollusks, who are extremely intelligent and will communicate their knowledge to those who ask.<br>The Calamarian seas are also home to the dangerous predators known as krakanas, sharklike animals with twin pincer tentacles. The rare ultima-pearl is found in the seabeds. Massive sea slugs, plying Calamari’s oceans, use the Force to draw plankton into their mouths. Other species include the eellike choarn, lampfish with luminous tongues, and the endangered whaladons. In ancient times the planet supported now-extinct, 10-legged crustaceans known as mammoth krabbexs.<br>The Mon Calamari had already constructed enormous starships and begun traveling space when their planet was discovered by the Empire. The Imperials planned to enslave the planet and, after meeting native resistance, destroyed three of its floating cities. A Quarren, Seggor Tels, is believed to have deliberately lowered Calamari’s defenses to allow the Empire’s attack; ever since, tension has been high between the Mon Calamari and the Quarren. After the Empire’s aim was made clear, Calamarian starships were converted into warships and the shipbuilding docks in orbit around Mon Calamari and its single moon became an important resource for the Alliance.<br>Many Calamarians were enslaved by the Empire, including the famous Ackbar, who was forced to be the personal servant of Grand Moff Tarkin. Ackbar was rescued from slavery by an Alliance force and later named admiral of the Rebel fleet. Six years after the Battle of Endor, the reborn clone Emperor used his World Devastators to attack Mon Calamari’s southern territorial zone, destroying most of Kee-Piru and Heurkea. The port city of Hikahi was also damaged, hurting the planet’s starship-building capability. Calamarian ships form the backbone of the New Republic fleet. But with the help of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, the Devastators were defeated. A year after that attack, Princess Leia Organa Solo visited Admiral Ackbar at his home in the seatree forest to bring him out of his self-imposed exile.

Luke Skywalker arrived to find Callista, and his B-wing was shot down. Leia escaped from Ashgad’s fortress and teamed up with Callista. After a series of confrontations, Leia killed Beldorian; Dzym escaped but was destroyed along with the other drochs; Moff Getelles was forced to retreat at the Battle of Nam Chorios; and Callista decided to stay on the planet a while longer.\",\"category\":\"P\",\"references\":[\"POT\",\"EGPM\"]},{\"name\":\"Nar Shaddaa\",\"originalName\":\"Nar Shaddaa\",\"description\":\"The so-called \\\"smugglers' moon\\\" found orbiting Nal Hutta, the Hutt homeworld.

The 2,000 stars of the Koornacht Cluster burn so brightly in N’zoth’s night sky that more distant stars are never visible, which contributed to the Yevethan view that their species was the only one in the universe.<br>Females of the species are called marasi and males are called nitakka. Young are born in separate “birth-casks” called mara-nas. Yevetha only consider killing to be murder if someone of lower status kills someone of higher status. High-status males have every right to kill their lessers for any reason, and such killings are commonplace and accepted. Yevetha are extremely adept with technology and learn new skills rapidly.<br>By the time the Empire arrived in the Cluster, the Yevetha had spread from N’zoth and colonized 11 nearby planets, even without hyperdrive technology. The arriving Imperials established an orbiting repair yard (code-named Black 15) at N’zoth and established a planetary garrison on the planet’s surface. The Yevetha were forced to work as Imperial slaves and learned much about the Empire’s technology by servicing its ships at the repair yard. <br>Eight months after the Battle of Endor, faced with mounting losses in battles with the New Republic, the Empire planned to evacuate all forces from N’zoth and to destroy the Black 15 shipyard.

He shunned combat, but followed Ooroo's request to aid Empress Teta in quelling an uprising on Kirrek.

Recognizing the importance of preserving and protecting such artifacts, and wishing to honor Ooroo's memory, Odan-Urr returned to Ossuss and established the Great Jedi Library.

A subsequent uprising by the followers of Freedon Nadd was put down by another Jedi force. At the same time, Satal Keto and his cousin Aleema, members of Tetan royalty, traveled to Onderon to learn the secrets of Sith magic, which led to their formation of the Krath and the political takeover of the Tetan system.

There is even some speculation that the Order of Jedi Knights began on the planet. Ossus was once covered with many cities and ground defenses, with the Knossa spaceport located near a range of rocky mountains. Points of interest included the Great Jedi Library and the peaceful Gardens of Talla. The steep canyon walls are still covered with elaborate murals, and some ancient buildings that still stand include the library and a Jedi meditation chamber. <br>Five thousand years before the birth of Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master Ooroo instructed Odan-Urr in the ways of the Force on Ossus. Odan-Urr later went on to build the Great Jedi Library. One thousand years later, Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas operated a training facility on the tranquil world. Among his students were Nomi Sunrider, Shoaneb Culu, Tith Kark, Qrrl Toq, and Dace Diath. During the Great Sith War, the fallen Jedi Exar Kun visited Ossus to recruit 20 Jedi Knights into the Sith cause. Before he departed, Kun killed Master Odan-Urr and stole a Sith Holocron from the Jedi Library. Later, an Ossan Jedi fleet was dispatched to the nearby Cron Cluster to defend the besieged station Kemplex Nine. The fleet was destroyed when the Cluster went nova, and the resulting shock wave threatened to devastate Ossus. An evacuation of the planet was ordered, and as many ancient relics as possible were loaded onto transports. At the same time, Kun and corrupt Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma appeared with their armies to loot the world of its valuables before the shock wave arrived. Kun battled the Neti Jedi master Ood Bnar, who turned into an unyielding tree to protect a trove of the earliest known lightsabers. <br>Meanwhile, Ulic confronted and killed his brother Cay, and was seized with horror and regret over what he had done. Most Jedi left the planet just ahead of the shock wave, which scorched and nearly wiped clean the surface of Ossus. Some Jedi survived, however, after hiding their families in Ossus' great caverns, and their descendants grew into the Ysanna, a tribe of warrior-shamans who use the Force to guide their primitive weapons. A 10,000-year-old lightsaber, given to Leia Organa Solo by Vima-Da-Boda, surfaced over 800 years before Leia's birth in an archaeological dig on Ossus. Six years after the Battle of Endor, Luke Skywalker visited an arid, sandy portion of the planet and discovered the Ysanna tribe.

Skywalker and his Jedi trainees followed the dark-side kidnappers and defeated them on Vjun, but were unable to free the captured Ysanna from their carbonite imprisonment.

Quick thinking to thwart pirates on his first assignment led to an appointment to the command crew of the Star Destroyer <i>Chimaera</i>. Over the years, he worked his way up to second-in-command, achieving the rank of captain. During the Battle of Endor, the <i>Chimaera</i>’s commander was killed along with other officers and Pellaeon took control of the ship.

Acting on Thrawn’s orders, he then hired Niles Ferrier and Mara Jade to find the location of the long-missing <i>Katana</i> Dreadnaught fleet.

He encountered Admiral Daala, who was trying to get the squabbling Imperial forces to band together, and aided her by inviting the 13 strongest warlords to a unification meeting. But talking didn’t accomplish the task, and Pellaeon watched when Admiral Daala gassed them all. As part of Daala’s grand strategy, Pellaeon led a fleet of Star Destroyers to join with her and destroy the Jedi academy on Yavin 4. But Pellaeon’s fleet was hurled across space by a Force storm brought about by the Jedi trainees, and by the time he got back to the vicinity, the New Republic had vanquished Daala.

Trained along with his younger brother Cay on the mining world of Arkania by Jedi Master Arca Jeth, Ulic Qel-Droma quickly mastered the art of lightsaber dueling. Even then, his self-confidence and brashness made him appear arrogant to some. When he felt they were ready, Master Arca sent the Qel-Dromas and their training partner, Tott Doneeta, to Onderon to help put an end to the violent civil war between the city dwellers and outlander beast-riders. <br>However, the walled city, Iziz, was still full of dark side power some 400 years after the fall of the Sith Dark Lord Freedon Nadd.

The Krath fomented war among the Teta system planets, and Ulic decided to infiltrate the group and learn their secrets. Aleema and Satal Keto, the Krath's founders, played along with Ulic. Satal eventually betrayed Ulic and injected him with a slow-acting poison that would make his return to the light side impossible.

Nomi and Cay Qel-Droma failed in their attempt to rescue Ulic from the Krath, and the anger inside Ulic exploded, leading him to kill Satal. <br>Aleema gave him half of a Sith amulet that had been given to Satal by the spirit of Freedon Nadd, furthering Ulic's transformation. Ulic was then confronted by another fallen Jedi, Exar Kun.

Immense 800-meter-wide cones acted as shields. Their faces were covered by thick armor plating honeycombed with coolant chambers, and their backs had huge tubes and fins to vent off the intense heat. The shadow behind the shield formed the protected area for incoming starships. Trailing behind each shield was a 400-meter pylon with a drive tug that provided sublight and hyperdrive thrust.<br>Normally, the shieldship simply took control of the escorted vessel via slave circuit at the Outer-Rim depot and jumped into the heart of the system, bringing the other vessel along for a ride that took about one standard hour. Ships without slave circuits had to be escorted to Nkllon on sublight drives, which took about 10 hours. <br>The success of the mining operation and its New Republic ties made it a target for Grand Admiral Thrawn. His second attack on Nomad City destroyed its drive units and long-range communications, and Star Destroyers attacking the Outer-Rim depot disabled all but one of the shieldships.\",\"category\":\"V\",\"references\":[\"HE\",\"HESB\",\"GSWU\",\"LC\"]},{\"name\":\"Shistavanen\",\"originalName\":\"Shistavanen\",\"description\":\"An intelligent but violent species.

Their weak shields make them easy targets for enemy vessels. Sh'ner carriers also have minimal weaponry: only six ion cannons, two tractor beam projectors, and 24 battle droids for emergencies. They normally rely on Fw'Sen picket ships for armed escort. The interior of a Sh'ner carrier holds nearly a dozen entechment labs for rapidly processing prisoners; giant batteries store the enteched life energies until they are needed.<br>A small command and entechment lab crew consists of only about 60 Ssi-ruuk, while about 500 P'w'ecks and 300 enteched droids are used as assistants and for manual labor. Each of the three P'w'eck landing ships aboard is armed with 100 paralysis canisters that can be dropped over major population centers, explode at an altitude of 1,000 meters, and spread Ssi-ruuvi paralysis toxins over an area nearly nine square kilometers in size. When target cities have been effectively neutralized, the Sh'ner carrier's landing ships descend to gather entechment subjects. Each landing ship can carry nearly 10,000 prisoners in confinement pens.

She was accompanying her husband on a mission to take some Adegan crystals, used to construct lightsabers, to Jedi Master Thon in the Ambria system when Andur was cut down by several henchmen of Great Bogga the Hutt. Urged on by his spirit, she picked up his lightsaber and slew two of the thugs before continuing with his mission.<br>On the planet Ambria, Thon convinced her to stay and train to be a Jedi herself.

Her training took her to the planet Ossus, where she apprenticed with Master Vodo-Siosk Baas and learned to make her own lightsaber. She was then drafted to join a Jedi team to battle Dark Siders, who were taking over the planet Onderon, and to rescue Master Arca Jeth and his students.

Although the Vratix already had colonized other bodies in their system, contact with the Republic ushered in a technological revolution.<br>The Vratix soon invented the healing fluid called bacta by growing alazhi and mixing it with the chemical kavam. The remarkable fluid was extremely profitable, and powerful Vratix operations spread across many worlds. With the rise of the Empire, two large bacta-harvesting corporations, Xucphra and Zaltin, negotiated a special deal with the Imperials, allowing the companies to gain a virtual monopoly on the bacta industry. The conglomerates controlled 95 percent of the galaxy’s bacta and became known as the Bacta Cartel. The human-owned companies long dominated the lives of the Vratix and ran the government. Total bacta output averaged 17 billion liters a year.<br>The planet-wide government was led by two canirs (chief officers) appointed by an elected council, each canir representing one of the two corporations. Because Xucphra and Zaltin were competitors, there was frequent governmental gridlock. The Ashern (Black Claw) terrorist group, which viewed the corporations as a threat, attempted to topple them. In the political confusion following the Battle of Endor, Thyferra remained neutral and profited by selling bacta to both sides. Two and a half years after Endor, the New Republic, anxious to please the Thyferran leaders, recruited the human pilots Bror Jace (from Zaltin) and Erisi Dlarit (from Xucphra) into the famous Rogue Squadron.<br>Thyferra has three spaceports.

Foreign workers, who are hired to make the bacta runs, stay in segregated areas around the spaceport. The port’s main building is a low two-story rectangle, with akonije trees growing through it and out the roof.

Xizor exuded natural pheromones that made most humanoids feel instantly attracted to him; his skin color, normally a dusky green, changed with the rise of those pheromones, going from the cool into the warm spectrum of colors.<br>Xizor harbored a particular hatred for Vader. About a decade before the Battle of Hoth, Vader had established a biological weapons lab on Xizor’s planet.

Xizor’s huge castle on Imperial Center was only a short walk through protected corridors to Vader’s palace. Every time Vader set foot outside his castle, Xizor had him under constant surveillance. Xizor had a number of legitimate businesses into which he funneled much of the ill-gotten gains of Black Sun.

La bataille eut lieu à proximité de la quatrième lune de Yavin, une planète géante gazeuse .La bataille se déclencha après que des espions Rebelles eurent dérobé les plans de la nouvelle arme Impériale de destruction massive, l'Etoile Noire. Malgré la capture et le sauvetage, peu de temps après, de la princesse Leia Organa, ces plans parvinrent au Quartier Général de l'Alliance, sur Yavin 4. Mais les sauveteurs de la princesse furent suivis et l'Empire connut ainsi l'emplacement de la base Rebelle. Trente minutes standard avant que l'Etoile Noire ne se trouve à bonne distance pour pulvériser Yavin 4, les Rebelles rassemblèrent l'ensemble de leurs vaisseaux. L'enjeu était simple : la survie ou la destruction totale de l'Alliance Rebelle.<br>Le plan Rebelle dépendait de la capacité d'un seul pilote de chasseur à se faufiler dans les tranchées de l'Etoile Noire, en évitant les tirs de laser des tourelles et des chasseurs Tie, pour finalement envoyer une unique torpille à protons dans une petite fenêtre d'évacuation thermique. Cette torpille provoquerait une réaction en chaîne qui détruirait la station de combat.La bataille s'engagea plutôt mal pour les Rebelles. Si au tout début, ils purent abattre un grand nombre d'Impériaux grâce aux compétences supérieures de leurs pilotes, ils furent vite dépassés par la supériorité numérique des Impériaux. Tandis que l'Etoile Noire émergeait de la face de Yavin et se trouvait en mesure d'armer son tir sur la quatrième lune, tout semblait perdu pour l'Alliance. Mais un jeune fermier de Tatooine décida alors de désactiver son ordinateur de visée et de se fier uniquement au pouvoir de la Force. Il n'avait qu'une chance sur un million de viser juste et il le fit, marquant ainsi le début de la fin pour l'Empire. La destruction de l'Etoile Noire prouva que le colosse était vulnérable.

Ce dernier réapparut plus tard sous forme de clone.<br>Ayant appris que l'Empire construisait une seconde Etoile Noire, encore plus puissante que la première, l'Alliance Rebelle voulut à tout prix détruire cette station de combat avant qu'elle ne soit achevée. Par ailleurs, des espions bothans apprirent que l'Empereur se rendrait personnellement en visite à bord de l'Etoile de la Mort. Il s'avéra que ces deux informations faisaient partie d'un piège que l'Empereur tendait à l'Alliance.Tandis que l'amiral Ackbar rassemblait la flotte Rebelle autour de la planète Sullust, un commando d'assaut fut envoyé pour désactiver le générateur de champ qui protégeait l'Etoile de la Mort. Ce groupe, commandé par Yan Solo, comprenait Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, les droïdes D2-R2 et Z-6PO, ainsi qu'un peloton de soldats d'élite. Ils utilisèrent une navette Impériale volée pour passer inaperçus à travers les forces Impériales et atterrir sur la lune forestière d'Endor. La synchronisation de l'opération devait être parfaite. Il fallait en effet désactiver ou détruire le générateur de champ au moment même où la flotte Rebelle émergeait de l'hyperespace. C'était la condition pour que l'attaque surprise puisse avoir lieu.Mais, malgré qu'elle ne fût pas encore \\\"achevée\\\", l'Etoile de la Mort avait un superlaser tout à fait opérationnel. De plus, une légion de stormtroopers et d'autres soldats Impériaux, chargés de défendre le générateur de champ, attendaient de pied ferme le commando Rebelle. Tandis que le groupe d'assaut livrait bataille sur la lune d'Endor, la flotte Rebelle se mit en position d'attaque mais le champ de protection était toujours opérationnel.<br>L'Empereur avait prévu que la flotte Rebelle serait cantonnée sur la face éloignée de la lune et que les chasseurs Tie parviendraient facilement à détruire ses vaisseaux. Ensuite, le superlaser de l'Etoile de la Mort pulvériserait tous les vaisseaux lourds de l'Alliance. Les Rebelles essayèrent de gagner du temps en utilisant les super destroyers Impériaux comme boucliers.Sur la lune forestière, les Ewoks apportèrent leur aide au groupe d'assaut, qui put mener sa mission avec succès. Quand les générateurs de champ furent détruits, le champ protecteur qui entourait l'Etoile de la Mort disparut. Lando Calrissian et ses chasseurs passèrent alors à l'attaque. Le <i>Faucon Millenium</i> et le X-wing de Wedges Antilles pénétrèrent dans la superstructure de la station de combat et lancèrent des torpilles à protons sur le régulateur d'énergie. Simultanément, Lando Calrissian bombarda le réacteur  principal avec des missiles à concussion. Les explosions ainsi produites déclenchèrent la destruction globale de l'Etoile de la Mort.

Elle fut une réelle menace pour l'Alliance. Intelligente et efficace, impitoyable et belle, Daala avait des cheveux couleur cuivre et des yeux verts très perçants. Originaire d'un coin longtemps ignoré de la galaxie, elle devint l'une des meilleurs atouts militaires de la République.Quand elle était plus jeune, Daala eut à subir de nombreux sarcasmes, ce qui était prévisible de la part d'une culture sexiste. On l'assigna à des postes qui ne correspondaient pas à sa valeur. Comme elle était une des meilleures élèves de l'Académie Impériale de Carida, une des écoles militaires les plus exigeantes de l'Empire, elle attira l'attention du Moff Tarkin, qui fit d'elle sa protégée et son amante. Tarkin voulait que l'Empereur ignore son existence tout comme il souhaitait qu'il ne soit pas au courant d'un projet ambitieux qu'il venait d'élaborer. Faisant d'une pierre deux coups, il mit Daala à la tête de son installation logistique ultra-secrète, appelée l'installation Maw, au coeur du champ de trous noirs situé à proximité de Kessel. Il lui donna aussi le commandement de quatre destroyers stellaires et la promut au rang d'amiral. L'installation, qui employait 180 000 personnes, produisait des plans et des prototypes pour les stations de combat de type Etoile Noire, ainsi que pour les Dévastateurs de Mondes utilisés pendant la bataille contre Mon Calamari et le Destructeur de Soleils.<br>L'installation Maw resta complètement isolée pendant onze ans. Quand la première navette Impériale y arriva, Daala découvrit avec stupéfaction que ses passagers étaient Yan Solo, Chewbacca et Kyp Durron, qui venaient de s'échapper des mines d'épices de Kessel. En les interrogeant, elle apprit avec non moins de surprise que Tarkin était mort,  que les deux Etoiles Noires avaient été anéanties et que l'Empire était moribond. L'amiral décida de se venger en utilisant la puissance de son arme absolue, le Destructeur de Soleils, contre la Nouvelle République. Mais Yan s'était rallié les services de Qwi Xux, le chef du département scientifique, qui les libéra et qui se joignit à eux pour voler le seul exemplaire opérationnel de Destructeur de Soleils. Furieuse, Daala détruisit une grande partie de la flotte de Kessel, ainsi qu'une colonie sur Dantooine. Elle faillit détruire Mon Calamari mais en fut empêchée par l'amiral Ackbar.Ayant perdu deux de ses destroyers stellaires, elle battit en retraite et se prépara à détruire Coruscant, siège de la Nouvelle République. Mais Kyp Durron la repéra et lança quelques super torpilles du Destructeur de Soleils qui détruisirent un troisième destroyer stellaire et endommagèrent le vaisseau de Daala, le <i>Gorgon</i>. Les forces de la Nouvelle République l'affrontèrent ensuite à l'Installation Maw mais elle eut le temps de récupérer les plans d'armes les plus importants dans les ordinateurs avant de faire exploser l'installation. Elle s'enfuit ensuite pour continuer le combat ailleurs.Avec le <i>Gorgon</i> quasiment hors d'usage et son pouvoir diminué, l'amiral Daala essaya de regrouper les seigneurs de guerre sous la bannière Impériale. Comme son entreprise était sur le point d'échouer, elle exécuta 13 de ces seigneurs avec du gaz asphyxiant, prit le contrôle de toutes les forces Impériales et d'un super destroyer stellaire, qu'elle baptisa <i>Knight Hammer</i>. Une fois de plus, elle s'engagea contre la Nouvelle République et une fois de plus elle échoua. Elle fut à deux doigts d'y perdre la vie mais sa détermination ne faiblit pas.<br>Quelques années plus tard, Daala refit surface à la tête de la Compagnie Indépendante des Colons, un groupe de 3000 personnes qui restaient fidèles aux anciens codes. Le groupe acheta 750 millions d'hectares sur la planète Peduccis Chorios pour y vivre en toute quiétude. Ce terrain appartenait au seigneur de guerre K'iin de la Silver Unifir. Après que les dirigeants de la Nouvelle République eurent déjoué un complot ourdi par le maléfique Seti Ashgad, Daala retrouva son ancien amour perdu, Liegeus Vorn.

Dathomir possède quatre petites lunes. C'est le repaire des Sorcières de Dathomir, femmes sensibles à la Force, qui chevauchent d'effrayants rancors. La planète s'enorgueillit d'une grande variété de paysages : montagnes, déserts, savanes pourpres, forêts aux arbres hauts de 80 mètres et aux buissons de baies de hwotha. Parmi la faune indigène, on remarque, outre les rancors, des reptiles volants, une espèce de rongeurs à l'allure porcine, de longs vers whuffas, ainsi que des poissons appelés burra. Des reptiles bipèdes, semi-intelligents, vivent dans le désert et s'intitulent eux-mêmes \\\"peuple du Désert Bleu\\\". Les premiers humains arrivés sur Dathomir étaient des fabricants d'armes illégales, exilés sur cette planète par les Chevaliers Jedi. Plusieurs générations plus tard, une Jedi dévoyée, du nom d'Allya, fut également bannie sur Dathomir. Elle enseigna la Force aux habitants de la planète et à leurs descendants, qui apprirent aussi à dompter les rancors, alors sauvages. Près de 400 ans avant la bataille de Yavin, le <i>Chu'unthor</i>, vaisseau Jedi long de 2 000 mètres, s'écrasa dans un puits de bitume. Les Jedi envoyés pour porter secours au vaisseau accidenté furent chassés par les sorcières. Celles-ci se divisèrent en différents clans (Montagne chantante, Rivière furieuse et Cascades brumeuses), parmi lesquels un groupe, qui avait choisi le Côté Obscur, s'était donné le nom de Soeurs Noires. Ces clans étaient marqués par un système matriarcal, où les mâles, réduits en esclavage, n'assuraient qu'un rôle de production ou de reproduction.<br>Les forces Impériales édifièrent des chantiers orbitaux de construction spatiale ainsi qu'un bagne à la surface de Dathomir. Mais l'Empereur Palpatine, informé du pouvoir de Gethzerion, chef des Soeurs de la Nuit, ordonna que fussent détruits tous les vaisseaux de la colonie pénitentiaire, pour l'empêcher de quitter la planète. Les Impériaux, bloqués dans leur prison, furent alors réduits en esclavage par Gethzerion et ses congénères. Quatre ans après la bataille d'Endor, Yan Solo gagna la planète au jeu du sabacc, contre Omogg, chef de guerre qui la prétendait propriété de sa famille depuis des générations. Les aventures qui s'ensuivirent pour Yan sur Dathomir entraînèrent l'anéantissement des Soeurs Noires et des troupes du seigneur de guerre Zsinj. Une quinzaine d'années après la bataille d'Endor, un nouvel ordre des Soeurs de la Nuit naquit. Ce clan, installé dans le Grand Canyon et fondé par Brakiss, ancienne élève de Luke Skywalker, passa une alliance avec les vestiges de l'Empire. Les hommes y étaient considérés à l'égal des femmes et les apprentis Jedi les plus prometteurs étaient envoyés en perfectionnement à l'Académie Impériale de l'Ombre.\",\"category\":\"P\",\"references\":[\"CPL\",\"COJ\",\"YJK\",\"DS\",\"ISWU\",\"EGPM\"]},{\"name\":\"Deak\",\"originalName\":\"Deak\",\"description\":\"Copain d'enfance de Luke Skywalker qui vivait à Anchorhead, sur Tatooine.

Le droïde tank se déplace sur des chenilles à plus de 70 kilomètres heure et peut traverser des cours d'eau d'une profondeur inférieure à 15 mètres. Le XR-85 est quasiment impossible à arrêter, ce qui en fait une arme très utile pour les opérations d'assaut urbain. Son arme principale est un canon à particules d'une portée effective de cinq kilomètres. Deux turbolasers frontaux, quatre doubles blasters lourds à répétition et un canon anti-personnel arrière complètent son armement.L'intelligence artificielle du droïde tank est l'un des rares systèmes doté d'un module intuitif sophistiqué. Le XR-85 joua un rôle majeur au cours de l'invasion Impériale visant à arracher la Cité Impériale des mains de la Nouvelle République, six ans après la bataille d'Endor. Bien que ses performances au combat prouvent que rien ne peut égaler un véritable pilote, les droïdes tanks sont de bien meilleurs combattants que les générations précédentes de machines de ce type.\",\"category\":\"V\",\"references\":[\"DE\",\"DESB\",\"SWVG\"]},{\"name\":\"duracier\",\"originalName\":\"durasteel\",\"description\":\"Ce métal ultra-léger peut supporter des températures extrêmes et résister à des chocs violents.

Condamné dès l'âge de huit ans à travailler dans les mines, ce gamin aux cheveux en bataille ne se doutait pas qu'il allait vivre une vie d'extrêmes, finissant par devenir un Chevalier Jedi après avoir été entre temps corrompu par le Côté Obscur. Une nuit, des stormtroopers vinrent expulser ses parents de la colonie Deyer dans le système Anoat. Politiquement engagés, les Durron avaient simplement exprimé leur indignation quand l'Empire avait détruit Aldérande et ses milliards d'habitants. Toute la famille fut envoyée dans l'Etablissement Pénitentiaire Impérial sur la planète Kessel, où il furent condamnés aux travaux forcés. Kyp dut extraire la précieuse épice narcotique dans des galeries où l'obscurité était totale. Zeth, le frère aîné de Kyp, fut quant à lui enrôlé dans la terrible Académie Impériale de Carida.Kyp passa donc ses jeunes années dans l'obscurité souterraine. Ses parents furent exécutés au cours d'une bataille qui se termina par la victoire du contrebandier Moruth Doole. Doole prit ensuite le contrôle de la prison et des mines. Parmi les nouveaux prisonniers, une vieille femme appelée Vima-Da-Boda repéra chez Kyp une aptitude naturelle pour la Force. Comme elle avait été Chevalier Jedi au temps de l'Ancienne République, elle put le former mais elle fut un jour emmenées par les autorités. Sept ans après la bataille d'Endor, Kyp fit la connaissance de deux nouveaux prisonniers : Yan Solo et Chewbacca, dont le vaisseau avait été abattu par Doole alors qu'ils se rendaient sur Kessel pour une mission diplomatique.Yan vit très vite que ce garçon de seize ans était doué pour la Force. Ce don s'avéra très profitable le jour où Chewbacca, plusieurs autres bagnards et lui-même furent attaqués dans la mine par les araignées géantes qui produisaient la précieuse épice. Dès lors, ils préparèrent ensemble un plan d'évasion et s'enfuirent de Kessel à bord d'un vaisseau cargo volé aux Impériaux, mais ils se retrouvèrent entraînés dans le Maw, un amas de trous noirs. La Force de Kyp leur permit de gagner la paix relative d'une installation ultra-secrète de l'armée Impériale commandée par l'amiral Daala. Leur évasion de cette installation, avec Kyp revêtu d'une armure de stormtrooper, déclencha une terrible bataille spatiale, qui eut pour résultat la destruction de presque toute la flotte de Moruth Doole.Luke Skywalker engagea Kyp à devenir un élève Jedi sur Yavin 4. En l'espace d'une semaine, il avait surpassé tous les autres initiés. Mais son impatience et sa colère faisaient de lui une proie facile pour le Côté Obscur. Le danger vint sous la forme du Seigneur de Sith Exar Kun, qui était mort depuis longtemps mais dont l'esprit encore vaillant était emprisonné dans un temple de Yavin. Kyp s'entraîna en secret avec Kun tout en croyant pouvoir maîtriser le Côté Obscur. Mais, dans un geste de vengeance, il ôta la mémoire à Qwi Xux, un ancien concepteur d'armes Impérial. Il s'associa ensuite à Kun pour récupérer une terrible arme, le Destructeur de Soleils, enfouie au coeur de la gigantesque planète gazeuse. Quand Luke Skywalker tenta d'intervenir, Kyp et Kun séparèrent son esprit de son corps, plongeant le Jedi dans un état proche de la mort.<br>Kyp pourchassa sa plus grande ennemie, l'amiral Daala, et faillit la tuer alors qu'elle s'apprêtait à attaquer Coruscant. Il essaya ensuite de retrouver son frère sur Carida, mais sans le faire exprès il incinéra la planète tout entière, détruisant ainsi l'objet de ses recherches. Plus tard, alors qu'il était sur le point de détruire le <i>Faucon Millenium</i> avec Yan Solo et Lando Calrissian à son bord, il fut libéré de l'influence d'Exar Kun par les autres élèves Jedi, qui avaient réussi à détruire l'esprit de ce dernier. Rétabli, Luke se proposa de poursuivre la formation de Kyp s'il renonçait pour toujours au Côté Obscur. Alors qu'ils étaient partis détruire un bonne fois pour toutes le Destructeur de Soleils, Luke et Kyp eurent à affronter une nouvelle fois l'amiral Daala. Au péril de sa vie, Kyp parvint à détruire à la fois le Destructeur de Soleils et un prototype d'Etoile Noire.\",\"category\":\"H\",\"references\":[\"JS\",\"DS\",\"SWCG\"]},{\"name\":\"Dutch\",\"originalName\":\"Dutch\",\"description\":\"Surnom de Jon Vander.

Il existe deux côtés de la Force : le côté clair porte en lui de grandes connaissances, la paix et la sérénité de l'esprit. Le côté obscur n'est que peur, colère et agressivité.<br>Mais les deux côtés de la Force, celui de la vie et celui de la mort, font partie de l'ordre naturel. À travers la Force, un Chevalier Jedi peut avoir des visions de lieux éloignés, effectuer des tours de force incroyables et accomplir des choses à priori impossibles. La force d'un Jedi émane de la Force, mais un véritable Jedi l'utilise pour la connaissance et la défense, jamais pour attaquer. La Force est un allié puissant, quelle que soit la façon dont elle est utilisée.Il existe trois domaines principaux de manipulation de la force : le contrôle, la sensibilité et l'altération. Seuls les êtres vivants sensibles à la Force sont capables de maîtriser les techniques Jedi. Mais l'entraînement nécessaire pour atteindre le statut de Jedi est long et requiert beaucoup de patience. Le contrôle est la capacité d'un Jedi à maîtriser sa propre Force interne. Ainsi, un Jedi apprend à contrôler les fonctions de son propre corps. La sensibilité permet aux Jedi de ressentir la Force dans les choses extérieures. Les Jedi apprennent à percevoir les liens qui connectent toutes les choses entre elles. \\\"Tu dois sentir la Force autour de toi\\\", disait le Maître Jedi Yoda à Luke Skywalker. \\\"Là, entre toi... moi... cet arbre... la pierre... partout !\\\" L'altération permet à un Jedi de changer la distribution et la nature de la Force afin de créer des illusions, de déplacer des objets et de modifier la perception des autres.Un Jedi Noir n'écoute que sa colère. \\\"Si tu t'engages sur le sentier obscur, pour toujours il dominera ta destinée\\\", a déclaré Yoda pour prévenir Luke. L'Empereur Palpatine, au contraire, tenta de pousser Luke à continuer sur le chemin de la furie aveugle et de l'agressivité. \\\"Abandonne toi à la haine\\\", a-t-il conseillé à Luke. \\\"Terrasse moi de toute ta haine et ton voyage vers le côté obscur sera achevé\\\".\",\"category\":\"T\",\"references\":[\"SW\",\"ESB\",\"RJ\",\"SWRPG\",\"SWRPG2\"]},{\"name\":\"Fornax, Cinq anneaux de \",\"originalName\":\"fire rings of Fornax\",\"description\":\"Ensemble de cinq anneaux virtuels de feu intense, qui semblent entourer la planète Fornax.

Au centre de chaque village se dresse une construction cylindrique en bois poli cerclé de métal, appelée dukha. Les dukhas renferment le Grand Siège de chaque clan, ainsi que son arbre généalogique, gravé sur le mur. Parmi la faune vivant sur Honoghr, on remarque un animal carnivore, le stava.Pendant l'une des batailles des Guerres Cloniques, un vaisseau s'écrasa sur Honoghr, ce qui déclencha de catastrophiques tremblements de terre et entraîna la contamination de l'atmosphère par des substances toxiques. Dark Vador proposa l'aide de l'Empire ; en échange de cette promesse, des commandos de Noghri prêts à tout s'engagèrent dans les forces Impériales. Les clans noghri furent déplacés dans la région des Terres Pures, tandis que des droïdes de décontamination Impériaux s'employaient, apparemment, à renouveler le sol des régions polluées. En réalité, l'Empire ne faisait que couvrir Honoghr d'une variété hybride de kholm, végétal qui empêcha dès lors la croissance de toute autre plante, supprimant toute vie sur la planète pendant des générations et condamnant les Noghri à rester en dette vis-à-vis de l'Empereur.Avant la mort de Vador, celui-ci désigna le Grand Amiral Thrawn à sa succession à la tête des commandos de Noghri. Mais ces derniers désertèrent, quand Leia Organa Solo leur démontra l'étendue de la trahison Impériale. Ils semèrent de nouvelles cultures le long d'une rivière cachée au creux de hautes falaises déchiquetées.

Quatre millénaires avant l'avènement de l'Empire, Kun fut responsable de la morts de millions de personnes. Tué par une force Jedi qui lui était supérieure, Kun survécut en esprit. Son esprit noir s'attaqua quelques milliers d'années plus tard à Luke Skywalker et à ses élèves Jedi. <br>Kun fut initié à la Force par le Maître Vodo Siosk-Baas, sur Dantooine. Trop arrogant, le jeune Jedi fut happé par le Côté Obscur de la Force. Il utilisa l'Holocron Jedi de son maître pour connaître l'histoire des Seigneurs Noirs de Sith, tels que Freedon Nadd. Se faisant passer pour un archéologue Jedi, Kun se rendit sur Onderon pour étudier les objets Sith ayant appartenu à Nadd. Mais le Maître Jedi Arca Jeth vit que Ken menait un double jeu. Irrité, Kun partit pour la cité d'Iziz puis pour la lune de Dxun afin d'explorer l'influence de Nadd. A l'intérieur du caveau de Nadd, il fut confronté à l'esprit du Seigneur Noir, qui le mena à deux rouleaux de parchemins où étaient inscrits les grands secrets des Sith. Ces documents menèrent Kun à Korriban, une planète désertique où, avec l'aide de l'esprit de Nadd, il put avoir accès aux tombeaux des Sith.Pris de doute, Kun décida ensuite de ne pas poursuivre sa quête, mais il fut assailli par l'esprit de Nadd et faillit en mourir. L'esprit lui déclara que le seul espoir pour lui était de se convertir totalement au Côté Obscur, ce que fit Kun à contrecoeur. Dès lors, l'esprit de Nadd lui révéla les anciens récits des Sith, particulièrement ceux du Seigneur Naga Sadow, où il était question des expériences que celui-ci avait entrepris sur  la lune de Yavin IV pour donner un corps aux esprits des morts. Nadd engagea Kun à poursuivre la tâche inachevée de Sadow en espérant ainsi pouvoir bientôt jouir d'une nouvelle enveloppe charnelle.Sur Yavin 4, Kun renonça à nouveau au Côté Obscur mais fut attaqué par les Massassi, des descendants mutants des expériences alchimiques de Sadow. Ils voulurent le tuer en lui faisant subir le Sacrifice Massassi du Sang et Kun dut une nouvelle fois recourir au Côté Obscur pour sauver sa peau. Il massacra tous ceux qui s'opposaient à lui, y compris l'esprit de Nadd. Mais avant d'être détruit, l'esprit de Nadd eut le temps de prévenir deux de ses disciples, Aleema et Satal Keto, les fondateurs du Krath, secte mystique vénérant le Côté Obscur.Dans les mois qui suivirent, Kun fit construire par les Massassi d'immenses temples selon l'architecture des anciens Sith afin de pouvoir capter un maximum d'énergie Obscure. Il poursuivit également les expériences de Naga Sadow, transformant les Massassi en monstrueuses créatures mortifères. Il se rendit ensuite dans le système de l'Impératrice Teta pour détruire les derniers disciples Sith de Nadd. Il arriva au moment où des Chevaliers Jedi attaquaient la forteresse du Krath. Mais Aleema et le Jedi déchu Ulic Qel-Droma avaient survécu. Après avoir déchargé sur Aleema son pouvoir maléfique, il affronta Qel-Droma dans un terrible combat au sabre laser. Les Les amulettes Sith que les deux hommes portaient se mirent à scintiller grâce à l'énergie de la Force et les anciens Seigneurs Sith apparurent pour conférer à Kun le titre de Seigneur Noir de Sith et à Qel-Droma celui d'Apprentis Sith. Au final, ils se joignirent à Aleema pour essayer de vaincre la République et les Chevaliers Jedi.Lors d'un Grand Concile de Jedi organisé sur Deneba, le Maître Vodo Siosk-Baas se porta volontaire pour essayer de détourner son ancien élève du Côté Obscur, mais il échoua et se fit tuer par Kun. Les batailles sanglantes qui suivirent, entrées dans l'Histoire sous le nom de Guerre des Sith, firent des millions de victimes. Qel-Droma finit par trahir Exar Kun en révélant le secret de sa base sur Yavin 4. La bataille qui en résulta eut raison de la plupart des temples de la lune et détruisit le corps de Kun, mais celui-ci réussit à aspirer la force vitale de tous les Massassi et put ainsi maintenir son esprit en vie, bien qu'emprisonné dans les temples qui restaient sur Yavin.4000 ans plus tard, l'Alliance établit une base sur Yavin 4. Plus tard, Luke Skywalker ouvrit une Académie Jedi dans le Grand Temple de Yavin. L'esprit d'Exar Kun se mit dès lors à agir, en entraînant deux élèves vers le Côté Obscur. Il parvint également à contaminer Kyp Durron,  un Jedi qui semblait prometteur. Quand Luke comprit ce qui se passait, il décida d'affronter Durron. Avec l'aide de Kun, Durron attaqua son maître et utilisa l'Eclair de Force pour séparer l'esprit de Luke de son corps. Mais c'était sans compter sur les forces combinées de l'ensemble des élèves restant, qui protégèrent le corps de Luke contre la destruction puis piégèrent Kun. Ils regroupèrent leurs volonté en une seule entité de Force et étouffèrent ainsi l'esprit de Kun.

Après sa défaite, Sadow et ses guerriers s'enfuirent à l'autre bout de la galaxie et s'installèrent sur la quatrième lune de Yavin. Là, Sadow força les Massassi à se mettre à son service. Ils bâtirent d'immenses temples en l'honneur du Seigneur Noir et le laissèrent mener sur eux des expériences terrifiantes. Au bout du compte, Naga Sadow provoqua une mutation de l'espèce et transforma les Massassi en de féroces prédateurs. Un millier d'années plus tard, Exar Kun arriva sur Yavin 4 et s'instaura maître des Massassi, les forçant à nouveau à construire des temples et des forteresses dans les jungles de la planète.Longtemps après la défaite de Kun dans la Guerre des Sith, mais bien avant la constitution de l'Empire, les Massassi privés de leur leader quittèrent Yavin 4. Ils laissèrent derrière eux leurs étranges temples, ainsi qu'un mystérieux gardien connu sous le nom de bête de la nuit. Alors que les forces Rebelles utilisaient Yavin 4 comme base, la bête se réveilla afin d'accomplir sa fonction de protecteur des temples Massassi.

Un grand nombre de rivières, aux eaux brunes et boueuses, sillonnent ses paysages à la végétation luxuriante, grouillants de formes de vie les plus variées. Si Mimban ne fut jamais colonisée par les Circarpoussiens, l'Empire y ouvrit une exploitation minière secrète. Les mineurs vivaient dans cinq agglomérations composées de baraquements de fortune, et travaillaient à l'aide de foreuses à énergie, pourtant interdites sur les planètes habitées, car elles entraînaient des perturbations électriques dangereuses pour les vaisseaux à l'atterrissage.Il existe au moins trois peuples intelligents sur Mimban : les Mimbanites, reconnaissables à leurs yeux globuleux, et désignés sous le sobriquet de \\\"verdâtres\\\", qui mendient pour se procurer de l'alcool ; les Coway, minces créatures de couleur grise, vivant sous terre ; et une espèce sans nom, revêtue de fourrure et dotée de quatre pattes arrière et quatre avant. En outre, on attribue à une nation mystérieuse et éteinte depuis des millénaires, connue sous le nom de Thrella, la construction des centaines de cités et de temples qui émaillent l'humide surface de Mimban. Les \\\"puits des Thrella\\\", cratères d'une profondeur quasiment infinie, bordés de dalles hexagonales imbriquées les unes dans les autres, s'ouvrent souvent sur des galeries latérales appelées \\\"puits des Coway\\\", qui mènent au monde souterrain peuplé par cette espèce. Parmi la faune de Mimban, l'un des animaux les plus dangereux est un énorme ver de couleur pâle, dénommé wandrella ; son orifice buccal est entouré de taches noires, et il doit à sa stupidité de ne jamais reculer face au danger.L'Empire confia le gouvernement de Mimban au capitaine-superviseur Grammel, qui dirigeait la planète depuis des quartiers généraux installés dans une ancienne ziggourat d'une hauteur impressionnante. Le légendaire cristal de Kaiburr, qui passait pour concentrer et intensifier la Force, se trouvait au fin fond de la jungle, dans un temple dédié à une divinité locale, du nom de Pomojema. Ce puissant cristal était conservé dans une statue du dieu, sous la garde d'une créature lézardesque qui, malgré son air apathique, n'en était pas moins féroce. Quelque temps après la bataille de Yavin, Luke Skywalker et la Princesse Leia, flanqués des droïdes D2-R2 et Z-6PO, s'écrasèrent sur Mimban, alors qu'ils se rendaient à une conférence.

Les Mon Calamari et les Quarren, tous deux originaires de la planète, partagent ces cités, bien que les Quarren à face de poulpe préfèrent vivre dans l'obscurité des niveaux inférieurs. Parmi les cités les plus importantes, on peut citer La Maison Récifale, les Fonds Coraliens, Kee-Piru, la Cité de Corail, Heurkea, et la Cité d'Ecume.<br>Tout comme pour les vaisseaux construits par les Mon Cals, l'architecture et la conception de chaque cité leur donnent un aspect organique, caractérisé par des angles arrondis.

Il existe depuis une tension perpétuelle entre les Mon Calamari et les Quarrens.

Pourtant, l'Ancienne République, comme les Chevaliers Jedi, l'ont de tout temps évitée. Cette aversion historique de la part des Jedi est due à l'une des espèces indigènes de Myrkr, les ysalamiri, créatures vivant dans les arbres. Les ysalamiri ont, en effet, développé un mécanisme de défense qui leur permet de repousser la Force, à tel point que, regroupés en grand nombre, ils peuvent en empêcher l'influence sur des régions entières. Le vornskr, prédateur également typique de Myrkr, utilise en revanche la Force pour traquer sa proie. Par ailleurs, la teneur élevée des arbres de cette planète en métaux a pour effet de brouiller le fonctionnement des senseurs. C'est cette particularité qui incita le contrebandier Talon Karrde à installer son quartier général dans la partie occidentale de la Grande Forêt du Nord. Cette base fut prise par les forces du Grand Amiral Thrawn, en représailles contre Karrde, qui avait aidé Luke Skywalker à échapper à la surveillance de ses gardiens, alors qu'il était détenu à Hyllyard, principale agglomération de Myrkr.

Malgré son immensité, elle se caractérise par une densité extrêmement faible, qui lui confère une gravité tolérable. En des temps reculés, cette planète était appelée Evocar, du nom des Evocii, peuple primitif qui l'habitait. Quand les Hutts arrivèrent, ils apportèrent aux Evocii des connaissances techniques en échange de territoires ; à la longue, ils s'approprièrent ainsi toute la planète, forçant sa population indigène à la déserter. L'Ancienne République installa les Evocii sur une lune voisine, Nar Shaddaa, mais leur sort n'y fut pas plus enviable. Une fois que les Hutts eurent totalement investi Nal Hutta, ils remplacèrent les structures qu'avaient édifiées les Evocii par leurs propres palais et temples, et allèrent jusqu'à rebaptiser la planète elle-même.Les Hutts transformèrent Nal Hutta, qui s'ornait naguère de paysages montagneux aux jungles magnifiques, en une sinistre planète envahie de marais putrides, aux eaux couvertes de détritus, entrecoupées de friches insalubres et infestées d'insectes et d'araignées.

Nam Chorios, dénuée de lune, gravite autour d'une étoile du même nom, reconnaissable à sa lueur violacée. Cette planète, qui ne possède aucune mer, présente une surface couverte à l'infini de rochers déchiquetés et d'affleurements de quartz et de basalte. Les nuits y sont épouvantablement glaciales. Des chaînes de montagnes cristallines réverbèrent la lumière. Ponctuellement, des cheminées minérales, appelées tsils, s'élancent vers le ciel ; les Dix Cousines sont un ensemble de ces tsils, disposés en cercle.Quelques minuscules zones vertes indiquent les endroits que les colons sont parvenus à mettre en culture. Environ 750 ans avant la bataille de Yavin, la dynastie des Grissmath envoya sur cette planète des prisonniers politiques, et y sema des drochs, créatures insectoïdes porteuses de la maladie de la Graine de Mort, en escomptant qu'aucun déporté ne réchapperait à cette contamination. Les Grissmaths installèrent, en outre, des emplacements de canons sur Nam Chorios, pour prévenir toute intervention extérieure en faveur des détenus. Pourtant, ceux-ci, de même que leurs gardiens, survécurent en exploitant les ressources naturelles de la planète. Aujourd'hui, les nouveaux arrivants de la période post-Impériale ont opté pour les technologies modernes. La secte des Ecouteurs Théran, installée dans des canyons ou des grottes, est en charge de l'artillerie de la planète. Les habitants de vieille souche manifestent un profond respect envers ses membres, car ceux-ci possèdent des dons de guérisseurs. Toute la planète a la propriété d'intensifier la Force, qu'il y est, par conséquent, difficile de maîtriser ou de concentrer.La plus grande ville de Nam Chorios porte le nom de Hweg Shul. La flore planétaire comporte, notamment, des haies de brachniel, des buissons de loaks, des mousses de crom et de gomex, des lichens, des arbres à boutons ainsi que des plantes diverses : podhoy, bolter,  feuille-bleue, snigvine, bott et balcrabbien. D'énormes boules antigrav fixées par des câbles servent à retenir la mince couche de terre qui permet de cultiver smoor, brope, majie et nisemia. Des tours de métal font office de tuteurs pour le branswed et le topato. La faune comprend, entre autres, les espèces suivantes : blerds, gebbecks, alcopays, mikkets, narjams volants rappelant des insectes, et des cu-pas, animaux de monture aux vives couleurs, proches des tauntauns mais plus adaptés aux climats chauds. La planète est également infestée de drochs, qui s'enfouissent dans la chair de leurs victimes, en consument les forces et leur transmettent la maladie de la Graine de Mort ; toutefois, la décomposition des rayonnements solaires au travers des roches cristallines de Nam Chorios a pour effet d'affaiblir ces parasites. Certains d'entre eux, à force de se nourrir de leurs congénères, ont évolué en une espèce de la taille du chat ; appelés drochs-capitaines, ils ressemblent à des crabes et leurs yeux se situent à l'extrémité de longues tiges. La planète est riche en platine et en ivoire minéral ; on y trouve également, au cœur des collines, des spooks, ou smokies, amas de long cristaux verts et violets.<br>Pendant des années, le pouvoir politique est resté aux mains de Beldorian le Hutt et de Seti Ashgad, usurier exilé sur Nam Chorios par Palpatine, à l'époque où celui-ci occupait les fonctions de sénateur. Grâce à Dzym, droch mutant, Ashgad parvint à la jeunesse et à la vie éternelle. Callista, ex-Jedi qui avait perdu ses pouvoirs, fut emprisonnée par Beldorian quand elle arriva sur la planète. Neuf ans après la bataille d'Endor, Leia Organa Solo se rendit en secret sur Nam Chorios dans le but de rencontrer Ashgad. Celui-ci trahit sa confiance et la fit prisonnière, puis répandit la maladie de la Graine de Mort dans la majeure partie du secteur. Il avait élaboré le plan de neutraliser l'artillerie de la planète et de céder à la Loronar Corporation les droits d'exploitation des gisements de smokies.A la même époque, les forces de Moff Getelles, qui contrôlait le secteur Antéméridien, soutenues par les chasseurs CCIR de Loronar, envahissaient le secteur méridien, selon un plan orchestré par Dzym dans le but de s'échapper, lui et les autres drochs, de la planète où ils étaient bloqués depuis si longtemps. Le B-wing de Luke Skywalker, venu à la recherche de Callista, fut abattu. Leia réussit à s'évader de la forteresse d'Ashgad et à rejoindre l'ancienne Jedi. Après une série de combats, Leia tua Beldorian ; Dzym en réchappa, puis fut éliminé ainsi que ses congénères ; Moff Getelles fut mis en déroute lors de la bataille de Nam Chorios.

Gravitant autour d'un soleil doré, N'zoth est un monde marqué par la sécheresse. A distance, elle est de couleur gris-bleu et apparaît entourée de nuages jaunes. Pa'aal est la principale lune de la cinquième planète du système de N'zoth. Les 2 000 étoiles de l'amas de Koornacht brillent tellement dans la nuit de N'zoth qu'il est impossible d'y apercevoir des astres plus éloignés. Ceci explique en partie que les Yévéthains s'imaginaient jadis être le seul peuple de tout l'univers.Les femelles de cette espèce ont pour nom marasi, et les mâles nitakka. Leurs enfants voient le jour dans des \\\"fûts de naissance\\\" individuels, appelés mara-nas. Sur Yévétha, le fait de tuer son prochain n'est considéré comme un crime que si la victime est d'un statut social supérieur à son assassin. Les mâles des couches supérieures de la société ont donc parfaitement le droit de faire passer les autres de vie à trépas, quelle que soit la raison de leur geste, et ne s'en privent pas. Les Yévéthains sont très ouverts aux progrès de la technologie, et acquièrent rapidement de nouvelles connaissances.Quand l'Empire s'implanta dans l'amas stellaire, les Yevetha avaient déjà colonisé onze planètes voisines de N'zoth, alors qu'ils ne disposaient pas encore d'hyperpropulseurs. Les Impériaux dotèrent la planète d'un chantier de réparation orbital (désigné sous le nom de code de Noir 15), ainsi que d'une garnison, installée au sol. Les Yévéthains, réduits en esclavage par l'occupant, apprirent beaucoup sur sa technologie en travaillant sur ses vaisseaux dans le chantier spatial.<br>Huit mois après la bataille d'Endor, l'Empire, confronté à des pertes croissantes dues à ses conflits avec la Nouvelle République, décida d'évacuer toutes les forces stationnées sur N'zoth et de détruire les installations de Noir 15. Nil Spaar, leader yévéthain, et ses troupes de choc tirèrent parti de la confusion générale pour s'emparer d'un destroyer, l'<i>Intimidator</i>, et tuer 20 000 citoyens Impériaux en dirigeant des tirs de turbolasers sur les vaisseaux d'évacuation. Spaar prit ensuite, au nom du protectorat yévétain, le contrôle du chantier de réparation et de neuf des vaisseaux amiraux qui s'y trouvaient.Nil Spaar accéda au pouvoir, en tant que vice-roi de la Ligue Duskhienne, après la mort de Kiv Truun, qui occupait jusque-là ces fonctions. Les installations de Noir 15 furent, par la suite, déplacées sur une orbite secrète. Les chantiers de surface de N'zoth devinrent le principal site de production des vaisseaux sphériques à propulseurs construits par la Nazfar Metalworks Guild. Douze ans après la bataille d'Endor, les Yévethains ayant fait, à l'époque de la Grande Purge, main basse sur toutes les colonies non humaines des bordures de l'amas stellaire, Nil Spaar revint sur N'zoth, où il fut accueilli en héros. Son vaisseau, l'<i>Aramadia</i>, atterrit à Hariz, où l'attendaient trois millions d'admirateurs, puis il fut porté en triomphe jusqu'à la capitale, Giat Nor, lieu de résidence de plus d'un million de personnes, sur les 700 millions d'habitants de la planète.Tout en haut du palais de Spaar se trouvait une nurserie privée, divisée en seize compartiments abritant des fûts de naissance. Au sol se trouvaient des grilles, permettant de recueillir le sang des sacrifices. Lors de la bataille finale de N'zoth, la flotte yévéthaine fut écrasée, car les esclaves de l'ennemi évacuèrent de leur système les vaisseaux qu'ils avaient pris à l'Empire.

Mille ans avant sa mort, Odan-Urr débuta sa formation de Jedi avec le Maître Ooroo, sur Ossus. Bien qu'issu d'une race non identifiée de prédateurs humanoïdes connus pour leur agressivité, Odan-Urr était un pacifiste qui aimait les livres et cherchait toujours à en savoir plus. Il évitait le combat mais répondit tout de même à la requête d'Ooroo, qui lui demandait d'aller aider l'Impératrice Teta à réprimer un soulèvement sur Kirrek. Avec le Chevalier Jedi Memit Nadill, Odan-Urr employa la technique de méditation combative Jedi pour amener la paix sur la planète. Peu après, il prédit l'arrivée des Sith et la Grande Guerre Hyperspatiale.Odan-Urr revint sur Kirrek avec le Maître Jedi Ooroo. Ils vainquirent les forces Sith mais Ooroo fut tué au combat. Perdu sans son maître, Odan-Urr passa plusieurs semaines à explorer les vaisseaux Sith abandonnés après la Grande Guerre Galactique. C'est à cette occasion qu'il découvrit un ancien Holocron Sith. Persuadé qu'il était important de préserver et de protéger de tels objets et soucieux d'honorer la mémoire d'Ooroo, Odan-Urr revint sur Ossuss pour y créer la Grande Bibliothèque Jedi. Mille ans plus tard, Odan-Urr, désormais connu sous le nom de Gardien des Antiquités, présidait de nombreux colloques Jedi au Mont Meru, sur Denaba.Quand le Chevalier Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma voulut combattre les sorciers Aleema et Satal en se tournant vers le Côté Obscur, Odan-Urr essaya de l'en dissuader en lui montrant une image d'Holocron où on voyait un Jedi tuer son propre maître. Cet avertissement eut peu d'effet sur Qel-Droma, qui devint un agent du mal, assoiffé de pouvoir et enclin au délire. Au début du conflit suivant, la Guerre des Sith, Odan-Urr fut très actif mais il fut tué par Exar Kun, le nouveau Seigneur Noir de Sith. C'est en essayant de voler l'ancien Holocron Sith dans la Grande Bibliothèque Jedi qu'Exar Kun détruisit le Maître Jedi en utilisant ses pouvoirs Obscurs. Odan-Urr avait une chair grise et rêche, de minuscules yeux et de grandes dents blanches qui lui sortaient de la mâchoire.

La faune de la planète comprend une espèce originale : le féroce oiseau-dragon. Plus de 4 000 ans avant la bataille de Yavin, Freedon Nadd, Jedi du Côté Obscur, apporta avec lui sur Onderon les néfastes pouvoirs magiques de Sith. Ses opposants, qu'il expédiait en exil dans des régions sauvages de la planète, se regroupèrent et domptèrent les bêtes de Dxun. Des centaines de ces chevaucheurs de monstres créèrent leur propre royaume, et poursuivirent d'incessantes luttes contre le pouvoir d'Iziz.<br>Quatre cents ans après la mort de Nadd, la Nouvelle République établit un contact avec Onderon. Une délégation de Jedi, parmi lesquels Ulic Qel-Droma, fut envoyée sur la planète pour restaurer la paix entre les chevaucheurs de monstres et la reine Amanoa d'Iziz. Après le décès de cette dernière, sa fille, Galia prit le pouvoir, aux côtés de son amant Oron Kira, qui gouvernait l'un des royaumes des chevaucheurs de monstres. Il s'ensuivit un soulèvement des partisans de Freedon Nadd, que réprima une autre force Jedi. Au cours de la même période, Satal Keto et sa cousine Aleema, membres de la monarchie tétienne, vinrent sur Onderon pour apprendre les secrets de la magie de Sith ; puis ils constituèrent le Krath et prirent le pouvoir dans le système Tétien. A la suite du soulèvement naddiste, les Jedi édifièrent sur Onderon un avant-poste construit sur les vestiges d'un ancien vaisseau de Nadd.<br>A une époque plus tardive, alors que la Guerre de Sith s'achevait, un Jedi du Côté Obscur, Exar Kun, lança une attaque des clans guerriers de Mandalore sur Onderon, pour s'emparer de la planète et de la ville d'Iziz. Vaincus, lors d'une terrible bataille, par Oron Kira et par le capitaine Vanicus de la flotte républicaine, Mandalore et ceux qui, parmi ses compagnons, avaient survécu, trouvèrent refuge sur la lune de Dxun. Six ans après la bataille d'Endor, c'est-à-dire plusieurs millénaires après ces événements, le <i>Faucon Millenium</i> alors qu'il s'était posé sur Onderon à la suite d'une avarie, subit des dommages encore plus graves lors d'un affrontement avec l'<i>Eclipse II</i>, vaisseau amiral de l'Empereur ressuscité.

Mais le Jedi Empatojayos Brand l'empêcha d'exécuter son projet.

Ossus, qui gravite autour de deux soleils jumeaux selon une orbite en forme de huit, était autrefois une place forte et un site d'entraînement Jedi de premier plan. Il semblerait même que cette planète vit la naissance de l'Ordre des Chevaliers Jedi. Ossus était jadis parsemée de nombreuses villes et installations de défense. Près d'une chaîne de montagnes rocheuses se trouvait un spatioport du nom de Knossa. La planète était visitée pour sa Grande Bibliothèque Jedi et ses paisibles jardins de Talla. On admire, encore aujourd'hui, les peintures rupestres aux motifs élaborés qui couvrent ses gorges escarpées. Certains monuments anciens, préservés de la ruine, abritent, entre autres, les salles de méditation des Jedi.<br>Cinq mille ans avant la naissance de Luke Skywalker, le maître Jedi Ooroo initia Odan-Urr aux voies de la Force. Celui-ci devait, par la suite, mettre son savoir en oeuvre en édifiant la Grande Bibliothèque. Un millénaire plus tard, un autre maître Jedi, Vodo-Siosk Baas, créa un centre d'entraînement sur cette paisible planète. Parmi ses élèves figuraient Nomi Sunrider, Shoaneb Culu, Tith Kark, Qrrl Toq et Dace Diath. Pendant la Grande Guerre de Sith, Exar Kun, Jedi déchu, se rendit sur Ossus, où il rallia vingt Chevaliers Jedi à la cause des Sith. Avant de repartir, il tua le maître Odan-Urr et s'empara d'un Holocron Sith, conservé dans la bibliothèque des Jedi. Plus tard, une flotte Jedi fut dépêchée d'Ossus à l'amas voisin de Cron, pour défendre la station de Kemplex Neuf, alors assiégiée. La transformation de l'amas stellaire en nova eut pour effet de détruire les forces ossiennes ; l'onde de choc qui en résultat faillit même dévaster Ossus. L'évacuation de la planète fut ordonnée et la population emporta avec elle autant de reliques de l'histoire ancienne de ce monde que possible. C'est alors que les armées de Kun et d'un Jedi corrompu du nom d'Ulic Qel-Droma investirent la planète, dans le but de la piller de ses richesses, avant qu'elle ne soit touchée par l'onde de choc. Un combat eut lieu entre Kun et Ood Bnar, maître Jedi neti ; ce dernier se transforma en arbre, de sorte de dissimuler des sabres laser, les plus anciens connus dans la galaxie.<br>Ulic, quant à lui, tua son frère Cay en duel et fut saisi d'horreur et de remors quand il comprit son geste. La plupart des Jedi quittèrent la planète juste avant l'arrivée de l'onde de choc, qui devait réduire la surface d'Ossus à un désert carbonisé. Certains des Jedi qui n'étaient pas partis, et s'étaient réfugiés, ainsi que leur famille, dans de profondes grottes, survécurent à cette catastrophe. Leurs descendants formèrent la tribu des Ysanna, Chamans-guerriers qui utilisent la Force pour orienter leurs armes primitives. Vima-Da-Boda offrit à Leia Organa Solo un sabre laser vieux de 10 000 ans, trouvé sur un site archéologique d'Ossus, huit siècles avant la naissance de la princesse. Six ans après la bataille d'Endor, Luke Skywalker, en explorant une région aride et sablonneuse de la planète, découvrit la tribu des Ysanna. Skywalker et Kam Solusar s'opposèrent aux forces de l'Exécuteur Sedriss, Jedi du Côté Obscur et  mirent au jour les sabres lasers enfouis, bien longtemps auparavant, parmi les racines du maître Ood, qui avait courageusement sacrifié sa vie pour empêcher Sedriss de s'en emparer.<br>A l'époque du départ de Skywalker, la Nouvelle République envisageait d'envoyer des archéologues explorer les ruines d'Ossus. Peu après, plusieurs guerriers de l'Empereur arrivèrent sur la planète, pour capturer trois chefs ysannas. Leurs corps étaient censés servir de matière première à l'élaboration de nouveaux clones pour Palpatine. Skywalker et ses novices Jedi suivirent les responsables de cet enlèvement et réussirent à les vaincre, sur la planète Vjun. Mais ils ne purent libérer les Ysannas, captifs d'une gangue de carbonite. Treize ans plus tard, Skywalker et Tenel Ka, en mission secrète sur Borgo Prime, réclamèrent des gemmes de corusca qui, selon eux, leur permettraient d'ouvrir une salle au trésor située sur Ossus.\",\"category\":\"P\",\"references\":[\"DE\",\"FNU\",\"DLS\",\"DE2\",\"YJK\",\"EE\",\"TSW\",\"EGPM\"]},{\"name\":\"<i>Outrider</i>\",\"originalName\":\"<i>Outrider</i>\",\"description\":\"Ce transporteur YT-2400 de la Corporation Technique Corellienne appartenant à Dash Rendar fut manifestement transformé pour les besoins de ses opérations de contrebande.

En voyant la débâcle à laquelle les forces Impériales étaient soumises, il ordonna à contrecoeur aux vaisseaux Impériaux de battre en retraite.Le capitaine Pellaeon s'attacha pendant des années à regrouper, avec quelques autres, les forces restantes de l'Empire. Il désespérait de voir l'Empire dirigé par un puissant nouveau leader jusqu'au jour où le Grand Amiral Thrawn réapparut et choisit de faire du <i>Chimère</i> son vaisseau amiral. Thrawn écoutait volontiers les avis du capitaine mais n'en tenait pas compte. Pellaeon commanda le <i>Chimère</i> durant la bataille de Sluis Van. Agissant sous les ordres de Thrawn, il engagea les services de Niles Ferrier et de Mara Jade pour localiser la flotte dreadnaught <i>Katana</i> qui avait disparu depuis longtemps. Pellaeon savait que le plus grand problème de Thrawn était de surestimer les compétences et la loyauté de ceux qui l'entouraient.

Déjà à l'époque, son assurance et son impétuosité le firent passer pour arrogant aux yeux de certains. Quand il jugea qu'ils étaient prêts, le Maître Arca envoya les deux frères et Tott Doneeta, un autre élève, sur Onderon pour qu'ils aident à mettre un terme à la violente guerre civile qui opposait les habitants de la ville des meneurs de troupeaux.Mais la ville fortifiée d'Iziz était encore tout imprégnée du Côté Obscur quelque 400 ans après la chute de Freedon Nadd, Seigneur Noir de Sith.

Peu après, le Jedi trouva la crypte de Freedon Nadd, ce qui déclencha le soulèvement des loyalistes de Nadd, qui kidnappèrent le Maître Arca et s'emparèrent d'Iziz. Ulic mena un contingent de Jedi pour libérer son maître et tua le roi Ommin, descendant direct de Nadd, ce qui mit fin au soulèvement. Durant cette révolte, Ulic tomba amoureux de Nomi Sunrider, qui était également Jedi, mais il fut séparé d'elle quand on le nomma Gardien du système de l'Impératrice Teta.Dans les mois qui suivirent, deux prétendants au trône qui avaient été exposés aux enseignements Sith par l'esprit de Freedon Nadd créèrent le Krath, un groupe de sorciers ayant recours au Côté Obscur.

Aleema et Satal Keto, les fondateurs du Krath, entrèrent dans le jeu d'Ulic mais Satal finit par le trahir en lui injectant un poison à action lente qui l'empêcherait de retourner du Côté Lumineux.

Cette planète est peuplée de Twi’leks, espèce humanoïde caractérisée par deux longues queues situées derrière la tête. Ces appendices préhensibles, auxquel les Twi’leks donnent le nom de lekku, leur servent à communiquer par des gestes délicats, bien que ces êtres soient aussi doté d'une langue, le twi’leki.Ryloth, planète montagneuse, présente une rotation tellement lente qu'elle s'effectue en un temps égal à une révolution effectuée autour de son soleil. Par conséquent, l'une de ses faces demeure toujours exposée à la lumière. Seule la zone crépusculaire située entre les deux faces est habitable. Les considérables perturbations qui agitent la mince atmosphère de Ryloth contribuent à répartir la chaleur sur l'ensemble de cette région, où les Twi'leks vivent dans des habitations troglodytes creusées dans les montagnes. Des éoliennes alimentent en énergie leur industrie primitive. Pour subvenir à leurs besoins alimentaires, ils pratiquent la culture des champignons et l'élevage de rycrits, animaux apparentés aux bovins. Les habitants de Ryloth vivent principalement du commerce d'une épice, appelée ryll, dont la consommation entraîne une accoutumance ; ils exportent aussi leurs femelles, fort recherchées pour leurs talents de danseuses.<br>L'état twi'lek s'organise autour d'un gouvernement clanique composé de cinq membres, auxquels incombent toutes les décisions politiques. Quand l'un d'entre eux décède, les quatre autres sont envoyés en exil sur la face de la planète exposée au soleil (région appelée Terres Brillantes) et un nouveau gouvernement est mis en place. Galactic Exotics, importante entreprise twi'lek, est à l'origine du développement des cultures vivrières sur Belsavis. C'est également sur Ryloth que se trouve le siège de SchaumAssoc., agence de publicité pionnière dans le domaine des médias et des relations publiques au sein du Secteur Corporatif.En des temps reculés, un modeste avant-poste fut créé sur Ryloth, pour servir de centre d'entraînement et de point de ravitaillement en carburant ; dépendant de l'Empire, il était toutefois souvent utilisé par des contrebandiers. Tarkin, alors commandant, décida d'en faire une base importante. Bib Fortuna, majordome de Jabba le Hutt, fut parmi les premiers à négocier le ryll au-delà des limites du système, ce qui éveilla l'attention de l'Empire et attira des trafiquants d'esclaves sur Ryloth. Fortuna, condamné à mort sur la planète, parvint à s'en évader et y revint par la suite accomplir sa vengeance, appuyé par une armée de malfrats à la solde de Jabba. Cette expédition punitive se traduisit par l'incendie de sept villes de Ryloth ; Jabba en profita pour s'emparer d'esclaves et de richesses, tandis que Fortuna libérait Nat Secura, dernier fils d'une grande lignée de Twi'leks. Fortuna élabora un plan pour revenir sur la planète et s'accaparer le pouvoir conjointement avec Secura, lorsque se présenterait une occasion propice. Peu avant la bataille d'Endor, Fortuna réduisit en esclavage la fille d'un chef de clan, appelée Oola, pour en faire une danseuse au service de Jabba. Tol Sivron, scientifique de la station Maw, Nawara Ven, pilote dans l'escadron Rogue et le Chevalier Jedi Tott Doneeta naquirent sur Ryloth.Quand la Nouvelle République eut repris Coruscant, l'escadron Rogue fut chargé d'une mission sur Ryloth, pour y chercher du ryll kor qui, mélangé à du bacta, servait à produire le rylca, remède contre le virus de Krytos. Les Rogues atterrirent sur le spatioport de Kala'uun, situé sur une des montagnes désignées sous le nom des Cinq Solitaires. Par la suite, le chef de guerre twi'lek Tal'dira et ses pilotes, volant à bord de vaisseaux hybrides X-TIE appelés Chir'daks, c'est-à-dire Graines de mort, devaient se joindre à eux.\",\"category\":\"P\",\"references\":[\"SWSB\",\"COF\",\"COJ\",\"TOJ\",\"CSSB\",\"TJP\",\"XW\",\"SWAJ\",\"KT\",\"BW\",\"EGPM\"]},{\"name\":\"Sélonia\",\"originalName\":\"Selonia\",\"description\":\"L'un des cinq mondes habités du système Corellien.

Les cieux de ses nombreux mondes urbanisés sont illuminés par les lumières multicolores d'innombrables panneaux de publicité. Il est possible d'y trouver une sélection incroyable de marchandises, et des touristes viennent des quatre coins de la galaxie pour y acheter des produits rares.<br>L'ASC, constituée de dizaines de sociétés, est dirigée par les cinquante-cinq membres du Plateau Direx, qui dépendent eux-mêmes de l'ExO. L'ASC dispose d'une exclusivité de droits lui permettant d'exploiter à sa guise les ressources du secteur. En général, l'ASC épuise les ressources d'une planète, puis se met au travail sur un autre monde, n'hésitant pas à utiliser des esclaves et à polluer gravement l'environnement. Comme il n'existe aucune concurrence interne, l'ASC peut fixer le prix des marchandises bien au-dessus de leur valeur réelle. Les commerçants du secteur n'acceptent que les Bons Monétaires de l'Autorité et le vertex cristallin.Une partie des énormes profits de l'ASC était secrètement reversée à l'Empereur Palpatine, afin d'éviter que l'Empire ne vienne jouer un rôle direct dans les opérations du secteur. De ce fait, l'ASC constitua ses propres forces militaires, comme la Police de Sécurité (appelée Espos) et une petite flotte un peu archaïque. Les planètes du Secteur Corporatif comprennent Ammuud, Bonadan, Roonadan, Etti IV, Kalla, Kail, Kir, Orron III, Duroon, Mytus VII, Gaurick, Rampa, Mall’ordian, Reltooine, Knolstee, Mayro et les colonies des Trianii sur les mondes de Fibuli, Ekibo, Pypin et Brochiib. Les Trianii, des êtres aux caractéristiques félines, se sont férocement opposés à l'annexion de leurs mondes par le Secteur Corporatif, et de nombreuses batailles entre les deux camps se déroulèrent dans le Bras de Tingel. Un armistice fut récemment déclaré, après trois ans de combats intensifs.Constitué à l'origine à l'époque de l'Ancienne République, le Secteur Corporatif n'était autrefois qu'un groupe de quelques centaines de systèmes dénués de vie intelligente. Les corporations autorisées à travailler dans ce secteur pouvaient acheter des régions entières d'espace, mais étaient surveillées de près par la République. Cependant, au fur et à mesure de l'augmentation du pouvoir de l'Empereur, plusieurs corporations alliées à Palpatine parvinrent à le convaincre d'étendre la taille du secteur à 30 000 étoiles. Onze espèces intelligentes furent découvertes dans ces nouvelles régions, mais ce fait fut habilement dissimulé. L'ASC fut constituée afin d'organiser les opérations du secteur, ce qui marqua le début de l'ère moderne du Secteur Corporatif.Yan Solo et Chewbacca accomplirent plusieurs exploits légendaires dans le Secteur Corporatif, comme l'évasion de la célèbre colonie pénitentiaire de Star's End.

Taanab fut le théâtre d'une bataille contre des pirates de l'espace, terreur millénaire de sa population paysanne ; d'envergure modeste mais d'importance significative, cet affrontement valut à Lando Calrissian, plutôt connu jusque-là pour sa passion du jeu, la réputation d'un excellent stratège militaire. Quelque 4 000 ans avant la Guerre Civile Galactique, un cargo, le <i>Kestrel Nova</i>, avait été capturé non loin de Taanab par des pirates. Il servit ensuite au Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma pour rallier le système Tétien. Des millénaires plus tard, Taanab continuait de subir, tous les ans, des raids de malfrats venus de la planète Norulac. Mais il se trouva un jour où Calrissian était au spatioport de Pandath, sur Taanab, lors de l'arrivée des pirates.<br>Calrissian fit le pari de leur donner une leçon, car ils avaient endommagé son vaisseau. Il dissimula celui-ci dans l'anneau de glace qui entoure la planète ; puis, lorsque les pirates passèrent à proximité, jeta des centaines de filets au milieu de leur flotte. Tandis que ses ennemis se débattaient pour se libérer de ce piège, Calrissian les soumit à un tir nourri de blocs de glace recueillis dans l'anneau lunaire. Enfin, Calrissian prit la tête de la flotte de défense taanabienne, pour débarrasser une fois pour toutes la planète de ses assaillants, tuant à lui seul dix-neuf pirates. Par la suite, Calrissian fut promu au grade de général de l'Alliance, juste avant la bataille d'Endor, en partie grâce à la notoriété que lui avait apportée cet événement, qui devait rester dans les mémoires sous le nom de bataille de Taanab. Environ cinq ans après, un clone de Jedi fou du nom de Joruus C'baoth orchestra une attaque Impériale sur Taanab, au cours de laquelle il détruisit un vaisseau de la Nouvelle République à l'aide des turbolasers du <i>Bellicose</i>, outrepassant ainsi les ordres du capitaine Aban.\",\"category\":\"P\",\"references\":[\"RJ\",\"RJN\",\"DFR\",\"DLS\",\"SWAJ\",\"EGPM\"]},{\"name\":\"Taanab, bataille de\",\"originalName\":\"Taanab, Battle of\",\"description\":\"Voir Taanab.\",\"category\":\"E\"},{\"name\":\"table de projection\",\"originalName\":\"light table\",\"description\":\"Ce système de projection holographique est utilisé pour générer des hologrammes et des holographes grâce à un appareil parabolique situé au centre de la table.

C'est le centre galactique de la production de bacta. Monde vert et blanc couvert de forêts des pluies d'une humidité insupportable, Thyferra ne présente qu'une faible inclinaison. Elle a deux lunes, dépourvues d'air et inhabitées. Vers le milieu de son existence, l'Ancienne République établit ses premiers contacts avec Thyferra. Ceci eut pour effet d'apporter une révolution technologique aux Vratix, auxquels la colonisation de planètes voisines n'avait pas permis un développement important.Les Vratix inventèrent le fluide guérisseur connu sous le nom de bacta, qui s'obtient à partir d'une plante cultivée sur la planète, l'alazhi, mélangée à une substance chimique, le kavam. Les Vratix étendirent cette industrie, rentable au plus haut point, à de nombreux autres mondes. L'Empire gagnant en puissance, deux grandes entreprises productrices de bacta, Xucphra et Zaltin, négocièrent un contrat d'exclusivité avec les Impériaux, qui leur réservait un quasi-monopole sur ce marché. Le conglomérat formé par ces deux sociétés, dont dépendaient dorénavant 95 % de la production galactique, prit le nom du Cartel du Bacta. Ces entreprises, contrôlées par des humains, dominèrent pendant longtemps les affaires de la planète, dont elles dirigeaient le gouvernement. La production totale annuelle de bacta avoisinait, en moyenne, 17 milliards de litres par an.Le gouvernement planétaire avait à sa tête deux \\\"canirs\\\", nommés par un conseil élu et représentant chacun l'une des deux entreprises du cartel. Les situations de blocage politique étaient fréquentes, en raison de la concurrence que se livraient Xucphra et Zaltin. Un groupe terroriste baptisé Ashern (Griffe noire), voyant une menace dans le monopole du cartel, tenta de renverser les canirs. Dans la confusion politique qui suivit la bataille d'Endor, Thyferra resta neutre, ce qui lui permit de vendre du bacta aux deux forces en présence. Deux ans et demi après Endor, la Nouvelle République, désireuse de se gagner la faveur du gouvernement thyferrien, incorpora deux pilotes humains, Bror Jace (qui travaillait pour Zaltin) et Erisi Dlarit (au service de Xucphra), au célèbre escadron Rogue.Thyferra possède trois spatioports, dont le plus important, appelé Zalxuc, fut rebaptisé Xucphra, parce que l'ex-chef des services de renseignements Impériaux, Ysanne, avait pris le contrôle de l'entreprise du même nom. Devenue chef de l'état, Ysanne favorisa cette société au détriment de Zaltin. Les travailleurs étrangers, employés à la fabrication du bacta, sont parqués dans des sortes de ghettos, autour du spatioport. Le principal bâtiment de Xucphra est une construction rectangulaire de faible hauteur ; des arbres akonije poussent à l'intérieur, et en traversent même le toit. Si la récolte de l'alazhi et la synthèse du kavam s'effectuent essentiellement sur Thyferra, des dizaines d'autres mondes, notamment Qretu-Cinq, en produisent dans toute la galaxie.Après la prise de Borleias par l'escadron Rogue, Bror Jace fut rappelé sur Thyferra, car l'un de ses proches était gravement malade. Sur l'information d'un espion, le croiseur Interdictor <i>Vipère Noire</i>, en opération près de Thyferra, attira son X-wing en dehors de l'hyperespace et le détruisit. Selon toute vraisemblance, Jace trouva la mort lors de cette attaque. (Son décès présumé devait faire les gros titres des journaux.) Après la capture de Coruscant, la Nouvelle République devint particulièrement dépendante de la production de bacta, nécessaire au traitement du virus Krytos. Cette maladie avait en effet été propagée par Isard, qui souhaitait s'accaparer le monopole de la fabrication du médicament, pour accéder à la fortune et au pouvoir. Une impitoyable Guerre du Bacta s'ensuivit, au cours de laquelle l'escadron Rogue, agissant indépendamment de la Nouvelle République, livra un combat acharné contre Isard. Les hostilités se soldèrent par la victoire des Rogues.

Mais quand Guri fut tabassée par Leia, Xizor sut alors que son château avait été infiltré. Très vite, il fut confronté à Luke Skywalker et une terrible bagarre s'ensuivit. Quand Skywalker eut recours à un détonateur thermique, Xizor laissa le groupe partir, mais pas avant que Lando Calrissian se soit débarrassé d'un autre détonateur prévu pour exploser cinq minutes plus tard. Xizor s'enfuit vers son repaire spatial, <i>Le Poing de Falleen</i>, à bord de son vaisseau, le <i>Virago</i>. Mais il mourut au cours d'un dernier affrontement avec Dark Vador, qui avait donné l'ordre de détruire son repaire spatial.\",\"category\":\"A\",\"references\":[\"SOTE\"]},{\"name\":\"Yévéthain\",\"originalName\":\"Yevetha\",\"description\":\"Les Yévéthains sont l'espèce dominante de l'Amas de Koornacht. Ces bipèdes squelettiques ont évolué sur la planète N’zoth. Ils ont des mains à six doigts dotées de griffes rétractables situées sous leurs poignets. Leur visage est paré de couleurs vives. Dans le ciel de N’zoth, les étoiles étincelantes de l'Amas voilent les lumières des étoiles plus éloignées, et les Yévéthains en sont arrivés à croire que leur monde est le centre de l'univers. En utilisant des vaisseaux sphériques voyageant dans l'espace réel, les Yévéthains sont parvenus à coloniser onze autres planètes et ont formé la Ligue Duskhan.Très peu d'informations étaient disponibles sur l'Amas et ses mondes, car l'Empire empêchait quiconque d'y accéder. De plus, les Yévéthains sont restés isolés pendant plus de trois ans après la bataille d'Endor, malgré le départ de l'Empire. En fait, la politique des Yévéthains était de tirer à vue sur tous les intrus. Au cours du règne de l'Empereur, le brutal gouverneur responsable de l'Amas organisa des exécutions publiques, utilisa les femmes comme esclaves et se servit des enfants comme otages. Les Yévéthains étant bons techniciens, ils furent forcés à travailler dans les chantiers de l'Empire, réparant et entretenant les vaisseaux de guerre. Ils apprirent au passage beaucoup de choses sur les technologies utilisées par l'Empire.Après le départ de l'Empire, les Yévéthains entamèrent un processus qu'ils appelèrent la Deuxième Naissance, en créant plus d'une douzaine de colonies et en restaurant plusieurs vaisseaux Impériaux capturés. La Ligue Duskhan s'appropria l'Amas tout entier, malgré le fait que dix-sept autres espèces vivaient sur certains de ses mondes. Douze ans après la bataille d'Endor, la flotte des Yévéthains élimina toutes les colonies étrangères situées en bordure de l'Amas, purifiant fanatiquement ces \\\"infections\\\" au cours d'une série d'attaques appelée la Grande Purge. Le Chef d'Etat Leia Organa Solo envoya la Cinquième Flotte de la Nouvelle République dans l'Amas afin de dissuader les Yévéthains de tenter d'étendre leur territoire et une guerre amère s'ensuivit.\",\"category\":\"Z\",\"references\":[\"BTS\",\"SOL\",\"TT\"]},{\"name\":\"Yan Solo\",\"originalName\":\"Solo, Han\",\"description\":\"Le contrebandier et joueur qui renonce un jour à sa carrière de hors-la-loi pour devenir un des plus grands héros de l'Alliance tout en restant une de ses figures les plus contradictoires.

Ses deux calottes polaires, couvertes de glace, bordent d'immenses toundras aux tons verts et bruns, séparées, à l'équateur, par une chaîne de montagnes violettes. Yavin 8 possède peu de grandes étendues d'eau ; toutefois, de vastes nappes phréatiques s'étendent sous le permafrost, créant de petites zones marécageuses pendant la saison estivale.<br>Environ 54 millions de Melodies, humanoïdes amphibiens doués d'intelligence, vivent dans les grottes et les lacs des régions équatoriales situées près des montagnes, dans la partie la plus chaude de la planète. Ces êtres naissent sur la terre puis, devenus adultes, adoptent un habitat aquatique. Leurs pattes se transforment en queue et leurs poumons en branchies, lors de la Cérémonie de la Métamorphose. Celle-ci se déroule, quand ils atteignent l'âge de vingt ans, dans une mare peu profonde tapissée d'une espèce d'algue inconnue ailleurs, qui produit de l'oxygène. Les Melodies sont, au cours de leur métamorphose, qui peut durer des semaines, dans l'impossibilité de quitter leur mare, ce qui les rend particulièrement vulnérables face aux nombreux prédateurs vivant sur la planète. Etant donné l'incapacité des individus adultes de sortir de leur milieu aquatique, ce sont les jeunes Melodies qui assurent l'essentiel des primitives fonctions de leur société.<br>La faune de la planète, très riche, comprend des poissons à dos d'argent ainsi que de nombreuses espèces d'herbivores vivant dans des terriers, et les animaux carnivores qui s'en nourrissent, tels que les lopers et les saute-mousse. On observe, dans les toundras et les zones montagneuses, dix-sept espèces d'autres herbivores, parmi lesquels le wolbak, le dysart, le dontopod et le songbuk. Les prédateurs de ces régions sont, notamment, le reel, sorte de serpent, l'ursod, capable de changer de couleur, le raith, espèce de rongeur, l'avril volant, le funambule serpentin et un arachnide, la purella.<br>Environ quatre millénaires avant la bataille de Yavin, des Massassi, venus de Yavin 4, vinrent sur Yavin 8 afin de chercher de l'aide pour leurs enfants, que le Jedi du Côté Obscur Exar Kun avait enfermés, par magie, dans un globe doré. Mais, les Melodies s'avérant incapables de leur porter secours, les Massassi gravèrent leur triste histoire dans les rochers du mont Sistra, espérant ainsi que quelqu'un pourrait, un jour, briser le sortilège. Dix-huit ans après la bataille d'Endor, Anakin Solo et son élève Tahiri arrivèrent sur Yavin 8, pour accompagner leur amie Lyric à sa Cérémonie de la Métamorphose, qui devait se tenir sur cette même montagne. Après y avoir affronté de dangereux prédateurs, ils découvrirent l'ancienne supplique des Massassi.

Les Sliths sont des serpents aux mœurs nomades, sillonnant le désert de nuit, en quête de petites proies qu'ils saisissent à l'aide de leurs crochets venimeux. Quant aux Gerbs, apparentés au lapin, ils sont dotés de très grandes oreilles, sensibles au moindre son, et de griffes métalliques qui leur permettent de fouir le sol. Le reste de la faune de Yavin 13 se compose essentiellement d'une grande variété d'insectes, de lézards du crépuscule, d'une espèce de serpent dont la peau, qui brûle en permanence, attire le soleil, et de plus de soixante types de tripions, animaux proches du scorpion.

Un seul ysalamari peut générer une bulle de 10 mètres de diamètre dans laquelle la Force n'existe pas. Ceux qui les ont étudiés ont émis une théorie expliquant que les ysalamari repoussent la Force comme une bulle d'air repousse l'eau. A l'intérieur de cette bulle, un utilisateur de la Force ne peut pas faire appel à ses pouvoirs ni manipuler la Force.Les plans du Grand Amiral Thrawn visant à renverser la Nouvelle République impliquaient l'utilisation des dociles ysalamari.

Les supports nutritifs furent conçus de manière à pouvoir être portés par Thrawn et ses hommes, afin de servir de systèmes de défense mobiles contre les Jedi.

Ces appareils munis d'ailes à géométrie variables avec des doubles propulseurs ont un cockpit qui offre un large champ de vision. Ils sont généralement armés de triples blasters sur chaque aile. Dans les plus récents modèles de Chasseurs de Têtes, les ailes à géométrie variable étaient remplacées par des ailes fixes, et la maniabilité fut maintenue grâce à l'ajout de réacteurs de manoeuvre. La verrière du cockpit était plus lourdement blindée et les afficheurs holographiques tactiques furent améliorés. Les plus fréquentes modifications consistaient à remplacer les systèmes d'armement ou à gonfler les propulseurs pour gagner en vélocité.
